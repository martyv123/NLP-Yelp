1.00E+00,1.15E-01,2.12E-01,2.15E-01,3.02E-01,,"Got this phone for my birthday and I’m in love! The screen is so high resolution and large, so everything pops. I watch movies on it, and I can see everything in perfect detail, which I’ve never been able to do before. I wish the free charge cord were a little longer, but they do offer one double the length sold separately. Perhaps my favorite feature is how durable it seems! I’ve been known to crack my phones in the past, but I can tell I’m not going to have any issues like that with this phone. Amazing quality. "
1.15E-01,1.00E+00,1.02E-01,7.58E-02,2.34E-01,,"All my friends used to make fun of me for my phone being “always dead” but not anymore! This lasts all day and charge up quickly if I need more juice. I’m not a huge fan of the new design and screen.  But that’s outweighed by the fact that it makes it super sturdy. I accidentally dropped it from my bathroom counter and there’s not even a scratch on it! The new operating system is super fast, all my downloads take the blink of an eye. Definitely recommend checking this out.  "
2.12E-01,1.02E-01,1.00E+00,1.09E-01,1.78E-01,,"I was so excited to receive this! I’d been looking for an affordable, high-quality cellphone for a while and I’m so glad I settled on this one. The price is so reasonable for such a fantastic display. The resolution is truly HD, which is perfect for anyone who watches video or looks at phones. If you are like me and spend hours staring at your screen, this makes it so much more enjoyable and easier on the eyes. My only complaint would be that the longer charge cord was included with the phone, it seems a waste to purchase on its own. Such a small nitpick though, because everything else is fantastic."
2.15E-01,7.58E-02,1.09E-01,1.00E+00,2.09E-01,,"Just replaced my older model with this and what an upgrade (without the big price tag)! I love that this phone can go forever without needing to charge. I use my phone for everything from work to games, so it was essential to find something that had a good battery life and clear screen with high resolution. I wish they offered an option with even more storage, because I would’ve upgraded. Very reasonable pricing. This phone is great for everyone. Stop hesitating and buy it now!"
3.02E-01,2.34E-01,1.78E-01,2.09E-01,1.00E+00,,"Now that I’ve had this phone for a while, I’m happy to recommend it. Firstly, it took forever for it to come back in stock and shipping took a really long time. However, now that I’ve actually used the phone, I admit it’s got all you could want in an affordable phone. That screen display is amazing: The colors are bright, the picture is crystal clear in detail, and the resolution is very high quality. The operating system is very fast, I can pull up search results in no time. I don’t have many apps so storage isn’t an issue for me, but they make it really easy to free up space if you need to and that makes the phone even faster. The charge is also fast. Still can’t believe how reasonable this deal was. "

1.00E+00,1.29E-01,4.40E-02,1.00E-01,5.95E-02,,"I’m a photographer, so I always love snapping pictures on the go. This phone has been perfect for that! The pictures are very high definition. The back camera is definitely better than the front camera though, my selfies always seem a little out of focus. But I mainly use the back camera anyways and they come out perfect. The colors are vibrant, background is sharp, and the built-in editing software is easy to use too. I can hardly tell the difference between photos taken on my DSLR camera and the phone itself. "
1.29E-01,1.00E+00,1.01E-01,2.34E-01,1.78E-01,,"Worth every penny! I splurged on this phone after seeing a picture online and it’s been my favorite guilty purchase this year by far. The glass back is so sleek, and I love the new darker color metal. It’s very professional and premium looking. I’ve even received compliments on how high-tech it looks. However, I am a little afraid about the durability- my fiancé has the same phone and broke hers within a week. So, maybe invest in a good phone case for extra protection. "
4.40E-02,1.01E-01,1.00E+00,2.04E-01,7.19E-02,,"Arrived on time and safe. This is my first time purchasing from this brand, but even though I was nervous about figuring everything out, it’s been simple so far. The set-up was painless, and all the features are very intuitive. However, I will say that I’ve noticed that it tends to heat up really quickly if I have many apps open, so I had to learn how to close out of them properly. Bluetooth connections are fast and reliable when I connect to my car. My daughter likes to use that to play music. They’ve made a loyal customer out of me! "
1.00E-01,2.34E-01,2.04E-01,1.00E+00,1.65E-01,,"I’ve been with this brand for years and loved all my past phones. But unlike past models, my family has experiences so many dropped calls since this purchase. It seems sporadic and I’ve tried updating… is anyone else experiencing this? Other than that, it’s perfect. I love the new water-resistant feature and I have noticed any scratching yet either. The display is very large and makes my videos look and sound like TV. I recommend upgrading your storage like I did too, so much space for all your favorite apps and photos! Once I fix the service issue, I’ll love it even more. "
5.95E-02,1.78E-01,7.19E-02,1.65E-01,1.00E+00,,"Save some money and purchase this model! Employees in store were super helpful and nice, so the purchase was a great experience. The phone itself is super fast and the new software is beautiful. The new charger card is longer and charges the phone quickly. The only issues I’ve had is the facial recognition not recognizing me when I try to unlock the phone. Luckily, there is a good user community that shares these tips and tricks through reviews and other online chats. Overall, exceeded my expectations by far. "
