"Here is my review for the neck exercise: The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do it to the end. 
In terms of picture quality, the simplistic drawing is very effective. Even though the neck is considered to be one of the main body parts influenced by one’s posture, we still need to remember about the back, the shoulders and the legs too. So additional drawings like that for the back would be great. 
Some parts of the drawings in the exercise were a bit unclear, for example the direction of movement. 
It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go tilting one’s head. 
The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. "
"This is not an ""exercise"". Exercise in my opinion is something that usually gets your heart going.  This is more of a stretch or warm-up technique. It could also be considered as a relaxation technique - great for doing in the work place or at school but not necessarily at the gym. 
Due to the common use of this exercise in dance or yoga, the drawing was very easy to understand. good visual representation for people who also do not know it.

"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
It seems like a basic stretch, good for releasing muscle tension and loosening up
Doesn't really engage a lot of major muscle groups
I certainly wouldn't call it a workout
Seems a little lazy calling it an exercise"

"This exercise is not very engaging and requires minimal effort.
-The exercise did not bring much relief.
-However, The drawings presented a clear way of how to complete The exercise.
-I would imagine doing This exercise for too long would be exhausting a"
"Some parts of the exercise weren't accurately represented in terms of the sequence they should be carried out in. The drawings should be accompanied by some text to give us a direction in how to approach them. I only carried out the exercises because the survey directed me to do so, if I saw these exercises elsewhere, I would not do them. I found that my neck was a little more stiff after these exercises as we weren't informed the duration of time to retain these positions for. Stretching incorrectly can actually result in more harm than good. The final illustration with the rotating arrows contains the most clarity as I immediately understood what to do. An explanation of what parts of your neck are being relieved in each movement would have been beneficial. Overall, these exercises are in need of directions and numbering of sequences."
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
- The exercise is overly simple and can be very ineffective without further guidance
- For this particular exercise to be effective, one has to hold each position for at least 10 seconds at a time. This should be noted along with the drawings
- The drawings were clear
- The exercise is very unengaging "
The exercise seems pretty pointless. I don't like moving my neck in weird motion. I guess it helps blood flow a little bit to your head. I just don't see any major benefits. It was straightforward and easy to understand though which is good. Some verbal directions would have helped but the images were still very helpful.
"How to do exercise was clearly shown in the picture.
Easy to perform
They should say how many times to do it
Painful and uncomfortable
They should warn you it might hurt and your neck might crack
The exercise isn't hard to do
I find it more comfortable to use my hands to aid movement. This allows for greater relaxation."
"Physical exercise and its usefulness is dependent on the objective you're seeking to achieve. You can't assume the exercise is productive to all, if you use physical exercise in an attempt to increase your strength then the exercise isn't particularly interesting and doesn't warrant be tried at all.
Furthermore, all these assertions which are being made are devoid of comparisons. To state that the exercise is engaging is a meaningless characterization. Bench pressing for instance is much more engaging than this neck exercise. 
As it relates to the instructions they were very clear and easy to follow. On that I'll agree with the effectiveness of the instructions"
"Here is my review of the exercise
The exercise was engaging but it lacked clarity in the step neccessary to complete it. Since there is no number indicating the order in which the motions are to be done in, it could get confusing. Furthermore, the lack of color made the motions very hard to focus. Additional text guides specially on how to complete the motions would be very helpful. The art of the drawings could also be improved since they are a bit unclear. Also neck is not really a major muscle group that would be used as compared to others such as legs and chest and arms. Further research should be done. On the other hand, the simplcity of the idea was very good."
"The exercise is done often
-The exercise is actually not good for your neck
-i was told not to perform The rolling motion of The neck often
-The drawings do need verbal directions
-was i supposed to roll or was i supposed to place my neck side to side"
"The image is unclear, and incorrect replications of It can cause injuries.
-There is no explanation regarding why we should be engaging in The exercise, to begin with.
-The neck is a very sensitive area, a bad move can cause a lot of pain which makes me distrust The exercise.
-Maybe including a video of an individual doing The move could better help The replication.
-do not engage without proper guidence."
"This exercise was very effective. Because I've done a similar one before, I know that it is useful in relieving tension in the next. I think because of my previous experience I didn't find an issue with the drawings -- I immediately knew what to do.

However, I do think that the back should be included since it is an exercise on posture.

Overall, the exercise is engaging and makes me more comfortable after doing it."
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
1.This exercise is engaging for people to do it when they are tired after holding the same pose for long time.
2.I am not clear about how effective this exercise is
3.In these pictures, we can not see the steps and movements very clearly.
4.The instructions would be more clearly with some verb describtions."
"The drawings of neck positions were clear.
The direction was unclear and could be made more clear.
The usefulness of the exercise is not clear. 
The exercise was not difficult.
The exercise was engaging. 
I am unsure whether or not this is a good exercise and would need more information about it.
I felt relaxed doing the exercise. 
I would not be opposed to doing this exercise again. "
"- The neck movements were very easy to perform, as the drawings were very easy to follow. 
- The amount of speed at which we're meant to move our necks is unclear. 
- The amount of repetitions we are meant to do is unclear."
"The neck exercise feels a little uncomfortable.
- The neck exercise is easy to follow and do according to The imagery, However One cannot be sure whether or not The extent, duration, etc. is done correctly due to lack of detail.
- The exercise was not entertaining.
- The exercise was short.
- The exercise did not specifically relieve any discomfort i had in The neck area.
- The exercise seemed familiar.
- i am unsure if i implemented The exercise correctly.
- i would not recommend The exercise."
"1. Although the exercise was a little unclear due to the picture, it can be easily figured out so that is not a huge problem.

2. The exercise was very simple and easy to do so it was highly effective.
"
"-It's comprehensive, and easy to understand
-I don't feel I need instruction to do this motions, as most people would do them if their necks hurt
-I'd be much more inclined to do this if the exercise had more in depth instructions, such as how long to hol"
"This exercise is fun
This exercise has lots of people to play with
This exercise is competitive
"
"some parts of the drawings were unclear
not sure how this qualifies as an exercise, it is more of a stretch
maybe add some verbal directions or a video 
explain what the neck exercise does for you an what muscles it works "
do not agree he doesnot know what he is tlking about
"I feel that the exercise is really easy to do, not engaging at all, people usually do it when they are stressed or after a long day at the office. I am more used to lifting in order to develop resistance and strength. I would find it useful if I am studying, and I feel that now that I did it I feel more relaxed. It is important to know that it exercises one of the most important parts of the body, and also keeps the muscles moving because sometimes we get so caught up in our routine that we do not even have time to exercise, not only our neck, but our entire body. "
"This exercise is relaxing as I'm in a very calm position
The drawing for the exercise is straight forward and it's an easy exercise to follow
I don't really know what happens as a result of the exercise
Furthermore, I don't really know what the main benefit of this exercise
"
Here is the review for my neck massage. I think the pictures should go with the number representing the order that they go in. I think it also should have some colors to attract more attention. Overall the idea is simple and good
"I agree with Sam. Even though neck exercises can be useful, I believe that focusing on the back and the hips is much more important in order to fight the negative effects of spending too much time sitting down. I also agree that the drawings were not enough. They did not explain anything regarding how far the stretching should go, the time of the exercise, the required number of repetitions or how to correctly do the exercise in order to avoid injuries and over-stretching.
I also believe that other types of exercise like yoga or swimming are better for the muscles and bones than just a couple quick stretching exercises. These are just a patch that don't solve the issues appearing as a result of a sedentary life."
"The order of the directions was somewhat unclear though generally easy to follow
The exercise itself is simple and convenient. It does not require extra effort and seems as though it can be performed in nearly any seated or standing position
Recommendations on when, where, and how often to perform the exercise might be helpful"
"The picture showing the exercise is good because it shows exactly what should be done 
The exercise is very simple and there are not a lot of things that could be done wrong when trying to do it 
it is not clear how long someone should do each step of the exercise 
This exercise seems effective in the short run and actually reliefs any pain there is in the neck
I am not certain if this exercise will be effective in the long run and if it is going to create any sort of damage to the neck "
"Here is my review:
- The exercise is short, and can be done anywhere anytime, which is good
- Maybe the repetitions to be done must be included in the drawing
- The drawings are not very nice
- It is not stated the minutes I should spend on the exercise
- Maybe several exercises could be offered, as this one is short, for someone who wants to exercise more
- It helped my neck, but the pain in my back is still there
- Maybe an outside breathing exercise would also help the muscles to relax"
"Engaging
Drawing is effective in showing what the participant has to do in order to do the exercise correctly
Verbal directions would be helpful as well
Showing what doing this exercise regularly will accomplish in terms of overall health would be helpful"
"Below is my review of the neck exercise completed: 
I believe that this exercise is useful if you are feeling stiffness or discomfort in your neck. The exercise provides a relaxing stretch and engages muscles on all sides of the neck. The exercise is quick and simple, which allows even the most impatient of people to complete it all the way through. I will say that some prior knowledge of this exercise is required to do it correctly. The illustrations are not very specific as to how far you should tilt your head to each side, nor did they indicate for how long each stretch should be held. Furthermore, no illustrations or descriptions were provided to tell you how the rest of your body should be positioned when completing this exercise. I feel that additional description should be provided to explain what the performer should be feeling as they execute the movements. I also feel that some explanation of what NOT to do should be included as to avoid any possible over extension or injury."
"The exercise is relaxing and helps to elevate a lot of muscle tension
- if you relax The muscles in your neck It can help elevate any headaches you may have
- The exercise can be relaxing but also painful
- One should not turn their head too fast as It many reverse The effect of The exercise
- The drawing was rather clear"
"The exercise is engaging for your neck
-The drawings were clear in terms of how to do The exercise
-The drawings kind of insinuated that It could be bad for your neck if you do It intensely."
"My Review for the neck exercise:
- Very simple and not extremely engaging
- Very relaxing and a good stretch
-Made me lose tension in my neck
- doesnt seem like an exercise
- easy to do at any time
- does not take long to complete
-would try again"
"I wouldn't consider this an exercise. It's more of a stretch.
It's something most people do to relieve stress or pressure without thinking about it. 
It does not fall into the category that I consider exercise because it was not difficult or complex and didn't require me to exert energy."
"The exercise was simple enough to do multiple times per day
The exercise relaxed my neck, shoulders and mind
It was unclear how many times to repeat the exercise
it was unclear whether or not to switch directions 
The exercise made me focus on my neck muscles which don't get enough attention
I am unsure whether tilting the head back is good for the spine
If done incorrectly this exercise could strain muscles and cause pain"
"The exercise was decent, nothing I would go out of my way to do. I would much rather do full body stretching. A massage would be better than the neck movement, and probably safer. I may do it again if my neck is sore. "
The drawing looked a bit strange.  Written instructions would've been helpful to include to describe how many rotations to do.  The exercise is one I've seen before and is common in helping to loosen the neck.
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
- The exercise helps you stretch out your neck and engages the muscle in your neck. It also helps you feels the tightness in your neck muscles.
- The drawing was a clear demonstration of the exercise. It could help to include a full body image. 
- Timing per movement would be useful information to make sure you can effectively complete the exercise. This would also help reap more benefits from the neck exercise.
- A video demonstration would definitely help.
- Any other direction could help enhance the quality of benefits from the exercise.
"
"i did not think The exercise was very engaging
- The simplistic drawing was effective in understanding The exercise, However, It did not indicate The amount of time to spend on each move.
- not clear about The amount of stress to put on The neck and did not warn anyone who might have a sore neck."
"The exercise was helpful
It helped relax my neck 
The pictures were a little confusing
Include verbal directions
It is unclear what the benefits of this exercise is
"
"The exercise is simple and easy to follow.
It would be better if it is a short video.
The appearance is not very attractive.
"
"the drawing is simple and easy to understand, exercise is effective, a video could help, "
"The exercise was engaging and effective.
The picture quality was good, very clear and easily understood.
Maybe mention to stretch one's back and arms as well because those often get stiff as well.
Also mention not to stretch too much otherwise one can become distracted and have difficulty returning to the task at hand.
Mention other actions to take when one is stressed and not only a few neck stretches."
"exercise was engaging
-pictures were good but should at least be numbered to indicate order of movements
-i think This is a good exercise for my neck but It was also bit painful"
I don't find it necessary to have additional drawings. I also agree that direction could be emphasized more and there could be some written or verbal instructions. 
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
1. This exercise is really engaging and it helps me to relax my body.
2. To talk about the instruction, the instructive picture showing in the top of the first page is simple and easy to read, effectively showing the steps of this exercise.
3.some parts of the structure are a bit unclear. It didn't tell us the extent of this exercise time or how many sets of exercise needs.
4.The drawing didn't contains the directions of the movement.
5. If the drawing contained text explanation besides or the verbal instructions, it might be better."
"The images lacks in descriptions, as it only requires you to complete the neck rotation without proper instructions. To avoid confusion, simple text should accompany the images. Additionally, the exercise itself is not complex and does not require much thought about the muscle groups and it would be helpful to see how the muscle group engages in the exercise and coordinate the exercise with numerous other exercises. There is no indication of the extent of the exercise and this could result in injury, as well as there are no warnings for those individuals that should not be involved in the exercise. To make the exercise more interesting, there could be complexities added to it. These could include how long to stretch each side and the direction of rotations that would be the most engaging to the participant. "
"The picture shows what you are supposed to do 

The exercise is very relaxing

it is not engaging

I like real physical exercises like soccer

This  exercise is boring

There should be another exercise

There should be more questions
"
The exercise is easy to complete. The exercise is easy to understand from the pictures. I am not sure how many times to do the exercise. This may be uncortable for some people if they have had neck injuries in the past.
"The drawings were clear and the exercise was effective and relaxing.
It would be more clear on the direction of movement for the last piece if there was some written or verbal directions to accompany it. 
It would be a better exercise if there were instructions to straighten the back and place your feet firmly on the ground shoulder length apart, a reminder to breathe, and that if something hurts to stop."
"The exercise is relaxing and should be done regularly by individuals. It was really simple to follow and understand. The drawing was really easy to comprehend. However, some parts of the exercise were vaguely defined such as speed and direction of rotation. Also, the body posture was not clearly defined and how long should one do it in order to relax. If some verbal instructions were provided next to each drawing, it would have been more easy for users to follow."
"The exercise was clear and concise
The exercise was not very engaging
I would like to do the exercise again
I would like to see more exercises like this for other body parts
The angle of tilt for the neck is unclear from the pictures especially the backwards neck tilt
Some words should be written about the intensity of each movement
There should be a set number of reps to do per exercise
An explanation of how often to do the exercise should also exist"
"This exercise is simplistic and easy to learn. You can do this exercise anywhere. The drawings are extremely clear, but do not specific speed or vigor required. This could cause stress on the neck if done too forcefully. This aspect should be intuitive to anyone who knows their body well, however. The exercise feels good on the neck and back, but does not engage other parts of the body. This exercise can be considered more similar to a stretch. It is very relaxing."
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
1. I have read a report for this exercise. It will hurt our neck for some reason, but I am not really sure about that. So I won't let my friend to do so. 
2. The instraction is not clearly for a activity. 
3. It is not a whole body execerise and people may feel a little bit relaxed for a while. and can not make the activity effective. 
"
"This exercise is comfortable and can be done anywhere. This exercise is also very simple, making it easy to do. The exercise only affects the neck, so I feel like a more engaging full body workout would be helpful. Some words underneath the image would've been nice to help explain more clearly what should have been done. Specifications like pressure, time, order of steps could've been helpful. Overall, this exercise is easy to do which is its strongest point. "
"The exercise made my neck feel more relaxed. Other than that, I'm not sure I would do it every day. Maybe if my neck hurts. "
"The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do the simple neck movements.
The pictures are simple however it is unclear how far to stretch, for how long, or the speed at which to do it. Could come with more instructions."
"The images are clear
Would like them to be real people photos
Would like to know how many seconds to hold it
Would like to know how many times to repeat this"
"-the exercise was very clear from the diagrams
-the drawings of the exercise is very effective in teaching the movements
-needs more direction with what to do with the rest of the body, are arms by your side? are you standing or sitting? etc.
-it's not cl"
The exercise is similar to yoga. It helps you de-stress. It helps you realign your body. It does not burn many calories and other types of exercise should be added. I would  make a video so people actually know that they are doing.
"The neck exercises were as follows

- They were pretty engaging and required me to focus on participating
- The pictures facilitated the process compared to if there were just verbal directions
- I would have preferred some written directions to go along with the pictures
- The pictures never mentioned how long I should do each exercise
- It feels like the exercise could be more or less difficult depending on what your sitting position was
- Needs to explain how this helps the neck
- Could add some more variations"
"Here is my review for the neck exercise: 

The exercise is not engaging.
I know that we should not do the last image of the exercise. 
It has been proved that it is not good for your spinal cord. 
Direction of movement and drawings were clear enough.
I believe during a study break this would be a good exercise to relax a bit.
Verbal directions for the exercise would have been nice. 
"
"It was engaging to do It with your head
-some drawings were unclear
-no verbal instructions
-no clear directions"
"It's unclear
Could be too simple
It's relaxing"
"Here is my review for hand exercise:
- The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do it to the end.
- Get a play dough and crush the play dough repeatedly
- Very useful exercise if hands tired
- Very clear directions of the exercise
- Very well recommended "
"The exercise was engaging for the participant.
The directions were not clear in terms of the order in which to complete the motions.
The directions lacked instructions on how long to hold the postures or on how far to move the head and neck.
I would hesitate to call this an exercise and would prefer to label it as a stretch as it seemed to loosen up the musculature but not to build strength in the affected areas.
The drawings should be accompanied with verbal directions concerning how frequently to perform the motions. They would also benefit with some additional words concerning preventative care (i.e. postures to prevent neck stress).
"
"Here is my review of the neck exercise:

I actually engage in this exact exercise daily (usually in the morning, throughout the day, and before bed). I was taught the exercise while playing on a soccer team.

The illustrated exercise was fairly clear in its explanation -- however by previously knowing the exercise I think it was therefore clearer for me.

I think to improve the clarity of the picture you would need to place the images in a chronological order, so that people know which neck movement comes after the other. I think the symbols are effective, and words/verbal directions would only complicate things. 

As mentioned in the above review, it does not mention how much stress to apply. However this is dependent on the individual, and they should move their neck in a way that is comfortable for them, rather than straining it.

The exercise is simple and effective, it relaxes my neck muscles and is convenient and quick -- you can even do it while sat down at the computer doing work."
"the exercise was interesting
it was similar to many exercises
it was helpful
easy to understand
maybe not innovative, but helpful"
"This exercise is great for stretching and improving posture
-This exercise can help you relax and relieve stress and tension
-One should be careful when performing This exercise to make sure they do not strain themselves from going at a fast pace and/or overextending their neck
-The pictures were straightforward
-There should be a description added to The diagram to tell The user why The exercise is useful
-how long should The exercise go on for?
-Additional exercises would be useful because This is very basic"
"- The exercises were really easy to execute
- The pictures were very clear which was helpful
- The pictures would've been more engaging if they were colored
- The pictures made it easy to follow along but there were one or two pictures that weren't so cle"
"Here is my review of the neck exercise:
The illustrated instructions of the exercise were effective in portraying the motion to be done. The exercises were engaging, and created some stiffness relief. The exercises were effective for the engaged body parts, however, overall, did not include the whole body. The direction effectiveness could be increased with some verbal instruction as well. "
"My review for the neck exercise: 
- It is not clear in the repetitions and amount of time to do the exercise. 
- The pictures are hard to follow if you haven't done the exercise before.
- The exercise is boring and not engaging at all. There are better ways to exercise more parts of your body. 
- Should focus in other parts of the body and not only the neck. 
- I feel this exercise is more of a stretching exercise than anything else. 
- Should explain the results of completing the exercise."
"The exercise is engaging and encourages you to stretch your neck muscles.
The drawings were pretty clear.
It doesn't feel like an exercise, more like a stretch"
"The exercises allow you to engage all The muscles in your neck.
The Pictures give a detailed visual as to how to perform The exercises.
It does not state how many times we should perform The exercises.
It does not state how much we should stretch our"
"The exercise was engaging and useful. It was more of a stretch and rolled my neck out to relieve stress and tension. I think some written/verbal guidelines would enhance the exercise. It would help make sure that all individuals performed it correctly. It is important exercises are done correctly so that injury could be avoided. The drawings were informative, but should also be accompanied with more arrows directing the movement. Information on the length of time and reputations the exercise should hold would be helpful also. Overall, the image was the most simplistic guidelines to follow."
"This exercise helped me relax.
This exercise released tension in my neck.
This exercise was depicted clearly in pictures.
This exercise is very effective.
This exercise did not only help my neck, but my whole body."
"I think the drawings are clear enough, but then the time for each movement is not so clear. There can be more explanation on which muscle this exercise can help relaxing. "
"The exercise was easy and effective. I think it would be easier to understand with written instructions describing the sensation you are supposed to feel. I felt that the illustrations represented the exercise well, however I might be bias because I have done these exercises before, so I knew what to do and didn't have to follow the pictures as closely as someone else might have to. I think this exercise is a great way to help with getting a kink out of your neck from sitting at a desk all day. I feel like people gravitate towards this exercise without even knowing or having these directions, so additional exercises for the neck could be extremely helpful. "
"The exercise as a whole has a relaxing quality but could additionally be paired with one to two other exercises to increase its effectiveness.  If other exercises are not available, then a suggestion to continue to complete the exercise throughout the day my be reasonable as the desired results may not be attained after the first round of stretching.  The exercise posed a benefit in addition to its stretching quality in that it allows its user to take a small mental and physical break from their work and engage in a mildly physical motion which can help them relax. The drawings depicting the exercise were mostly clear but in some cases the user my not know weather to rotate the head or to simply leave it in a fixed position as part of the stretch. Similarly, no direction was given on the extent to which to stretch the neck in any of the given positions. Therefore some unknowns could arise and the desired results may not have been attained by someone who did not have former knowledge of the stretch or some form of additional instruction. An advantage and a strong upside to the stretch is that it is easy and does not require any additional space or equipment. "
"This neck exercise is very straight-forward and the complexity is low. Based of the illustrations, I had a very easy time completing the exercise. However, the illustrations do not explain how far on must turn or bend their neck. This could be dangerous because one does not one to over stretch their neck and injure it. In addition, I would like to know how many times I should do the exercise per day. Finally, I believe it would be beneficial if the illustrations described why this exercise is important. For example, should this be done if one's neck is sore or everyday to  boost neck mobility."
"The exercise feels really good for loosening up a tense neck.
The exercise instructions were a bit unclear, but were able to be followed.
The exercise is quick and easy.
Written directions would help make the exercise more clear/easy to understand.
The exercise is relaxing.
The exercise is comfortable and does not put any strain on your muscles.
"
The exercise is considered more a stretching that one would do before actual rigorous exercise. This exercise would be necessary in order not to tweak any neck or upper shoulder muscles during other exercises. This exercise is simple. This exercise is not time consuming. This exercise helps with flexibility and blood flow. This exercise can be done by all ages. This exercise may help those with neck problems if done correctly. This exercise is low intensity and energy. 
"Here's my review for the neck exercise:
* The exercise serves as a good reminder me how much I need to pay attention to my body
* The drawings are helpful and I think it's a good idea
* It is interesting how the questions are asked because I never thought of a neck exercise
* I would say this is one of the most creative exercise in content  "
"Here is my review for the necks exercise:

The exercise is interesting and useful for your neck.

The drawing is simple but there should be video instructions, a drawing usually is not sufficient to understand what you have to do with your exercise.

This exercise is famous and I think that should have been mentioned.

The exercise can be used in many settings (e.g schoo, office)

I would have liked to know how the exercise helps me relax and what time of the days we could do it."
The exercise felt relaxing and was easy to do. If you have never seen someone do this exercise before you may have been confused by the pictures - some written aids could have helped in this case.
"It is definitely relaxing

There is nothing really special. Before looking at the exercise I did it on my own.

I assume that the exercise causes no harm or injuries to the neck area

The picture is clear and simple

Would definitely try other neck exercises like this that don't require much time and effort

It is easy to do therefore one can do it multiple times a day"
"The exercise is helpful and relax
The exercise should be consistent 
it help me release stress


 
"
The exercise helps to relieve tension in the neck and shoulders. It is easy to do for all people. You must be careful not to get dizzy during this exercise. It will increase flexibility in the neck. It is something that you can do at any time or place.
"The exercise in engaging.
More illustrations should be provided like a video.
"
"The exercise was simple and easy to follow
It took a small amount of time to complete the exercise
There are many similar exercises that focus on different things
There was no direction on how long to hold each pose
There is not much of a change in how I felt after completing the exercise
"
"I thought the exercise was simple and engaging. I liked the exercise because you can easily do it at your desk when doing work, homework, or simply sitting down. I think the picture is easy to understand but I would add arrows to show the flow of the exercises. I also think that adding some verbal directions would make it more clear."
I am not writing a review on a neck exercise.
"The exercise was good and quick. I wasn't sure what order to do the exercises in, so I was unsure if I was doing it correctly. It felt good on my neck, and was something I don't often do. It did not mention how long each exercise should go for -- I did it quickly and felt like that was incorrect so I did it a second time. I think some numbers to show the order along with a time frame could be beneficial. Also describing how far to bend / twist."
"the exercise is not really engaging and does not encourage you to do it to the end.
The picture did not have a really good quality but the simplicity of the drawing makes it effective. the neck is one of the most important part of the body but i think that as mentioned at the beginning of the survey, many students spend a lot of hours in front of their computer per day. it would be interesting to see if there were exercises for the back which could help the posture while remaining on a seat for a while. 
"
"This exercise seems useful in terms of helping stretch your neck. I am not really sure how effective this exercise is with helping with posture. I would definitely do this again and I am a big proponent for stretching and cracking of joints in terms of helping myself feel better. There was not much explanation in how to do the exercise however, it does not really differ from a lot of the diagrams that one would get at physical therapy. I think that like the above statement that it could be helpful if there were words or descriptions on exactly how to do the exercise. Potentially a video could be useful as well. With stretching you do not want to hurt yourself so the more specific directions the better. I do like the fact that it is an easy and quick exercise though and definitely seems like something that I could do during the day because it does not take that much time to complete it."
"The neck needs to be stretched often due to The way we hold our head when we type or read
-you can do This While sitting down
-you can do It whenever you think of It
-does not require a yoga mat
-easy to explain to others
-good to do when waking up
-good to do when taking a break from work"
"The exercise is involving The mind
-- It is easy to do and does not take much effort
-- It is also not time consuming
-- The drawing helped explain The exercise well
-- It refreshes The mind While in front of The computer"
"It is easy to pick up on.
It is fairly straightforward to perform
A video or more detailed instructions would be more helpful.
That would help increase efficiency"
Good exercise to loosen up the neck. Easy to follow instructions. 
The exercise made my neck feel loose. It helped relieve tension. It was very easy to do. The diagram and pictures explained clearly how to do it. I think it will help me in the future with neck tension.
"The exercise is something I have done before on my own.
It is a simple exercise.
This is a good exercise for beginners, young and old.
This exercise makes me feel more relaxed.
I wish I had more time to exercise like this.
I have never had to write 8-10 sentences on neck exercises before and this is probably redundant.
I would be interested in seeing more exercises like this.
This would be a nice exercise for the morning.
Consult your doctor before participating in any exercise."
"The exercise is easy to follow and the pictures are descriptive. My complaint is that it does not come with a numbered order or an explanation for what each step is helping you achieve when you complete it. 

A usage situation could also be provided."
"My Review the neck exercise: 

I believe that the neck exercise helps students take a breath when they have been studying for a long time. Since we tend to maintain our neck in a rigid position, this exercise relaxes at the same time that it removes tension from the muscle.
Additionally, for a simple idea as a neck exercise I think that using picture graphics is more effective than a descriptive verbal instruction. I also believe that it should contain a time frame that says for how long should we do it and if it is recommend it to repeat it every once in a while. 

Overall, it is somewhat effective when trying to release muscle tension, however it should contain other options for different parts or additional neck exercises in case the one displayed doesn't relieve neck tension. "
"This exercise is not complex and therefore makes me feel like I am doing it right. 
It engages me and relaxes me as I try to get in my head and only think about my neck movements. 
It makes me feel rejuvenated by stretching the stiff muscles in my neck. 
My neck and shoulders are usually most tense, which is why I like to exercise them. 
The drawings helped me to effectively perform the activity. 
However, it was slightly difficult to rate this exercise without knowing what results it was supposed to have for me.
I assumed it was meant to calm me. "
" The exercise was engaging and is good for warming up your body and enhancing flexibility
- The image gave perfect visuals when It came to how to do The exercises. could be better if It gave insight on what not to do in order to hurt yourself While doing The exercise."
"This is a simple, effective neck stretch exercise. 
The directions should have some cadence or hold count on the exercise. 
Drawing showing the movement is adequate.
An explanation of what the stretch does and why would be helpful for some. 
More upper body stretches related could be included. 
This could include shoulder rolls, side stretch with arm over head, shoulder dislocates, and more.  "
"Here's my review for the neck excercise:

- It's a great excercise since it gives you the flexibility to do it wherever you are (office, school, library, etc)
- After doing this excercise, you feel less tense and relieved
- I would've liked to have the exact steps, as well as the frequency (Seconds) and also how many times we should repeat each movement
- It would be great to have descriptions below each picture 
- I'd like to know what the benefits of doing this would be in the long run 
- The images were very clear, and I knew exactly what to do 
- Maybe add more moving images (gifs) for even more accuracy 
"
"My review for the neck exercise is provided below.
- I felt an immediate relief after practicing the neck exercise.
- I liked the fact they the activity did not require much physical strength and resistance.
- In terms of the amount of force you should use when doing this activity, it is unclear based on the image.
- The drawing should be accompanied by a short description of what to do.
- The image should show what areas of the body will be affected by this exercise.

"
"Since I already know this exercise, I picked it up pretty quickly when I see the drawings. 

I like the exercise because it is easy, fast and convenient. I can do it anywhere at any time.

Now that I think about it, the drawing is simple and easy to understand. The exercise itself is too simple for anyone to misinterpret it. 
"
"The exercise provides stress relief. It is especially useful after looking at computers and craning your neck all day.
My neck especially gets very stiff so stretching and relaxing it helps me stay comfortable and focus.
The stretch acts as a small studying break.
A video would be a much better representation of the exercise than drawings."
"The drawings were easy to follow and made doing The exercise correctly simple enough.

- The exercise does not indicate how much time One should spend doing each movement. Adding directions to include how long to hold each movement and how often per (day or week) One should do This would be helpful.

- if There is a best order to do these exercises in that could be included as well.

- i would have life to see More exercises or ones that engaged other body parts as well primarily shoulders."
"I thought that the directions were simple and relatively easy to understand. While the accompanying images were helpful in allowing me to understand the exercises, they didn't include the period of time for which the exercises should be completed. The directions also didn't include the number of times each part should be completed. The directions also should've included the direction in which I should rotate my head because that aspect of the exercise probably matters. The exercise felt good though and I enjoyed the experience. "
"The pictures were easily understood as I had done this type of exercise before. It is useful especially for people who had been looking at their cell phones and PCs all day. 
The picture would not be considered as clear if I had not done the exercise before."
Not bad but sounds more interesting than a neck exercise
"The exercise was relaxing for the neck, and the drawings made it easy for anyone new to the exercise to perform it. I have done this exercise numerous times, and just based on the fact that I am not a fan of such relaxing/slow motion exercise I do not typically like to engage in it. However, I think this is a good one for anyone who is sore in their neck, higher back area to do. "
"This is a really good exercise that targets muscles that become tense while sitting at a desk all day. I didn't realize how tight my neck was until I started doing this. I found this useful but there are some adjustments I would recommend. For starters, there was very little direction about how long to do each exercise, how often to do it, and how far to extend the neck. Without this, the data collected from each individual is unreliable because there is no standardization. Also, the images could be unclear or misinterpreted by people so it would have been helpful to have some textual accompaniment. "
"The survey is easy to do. The pictures allowed for me to know exactly what to do. The 
exercise was straight to the point. What was unclear was how many times should it be done. The pictures were simple enough for me to do it without thinking what a hassle. I think the pictures were simple which made me think that it was easy enough for me to do and enjoy doing it. "
"The illustrations allow the excerise to be easily followed.
It is a very simple excercise with simple instructions.
Some of the drawings were not helpful in understanding what you must do. 
The last drawing was the most descriptive with neck movement.
It is not clear how long you should do this excercise for. Also does not tell you how long you should hold each position for. 
It would be helpful if there were descriptions of each step.
"
"The exercise was definitely relaxing
- More importantly, The topic of This exercise brought to my notice that i had been sitting in an uncomfortable position for hours.
- This is an easy to do exercise and i would love to make This a part of my routine except i tend to not realise that i am having a bad posture until my neck starts to hurt."
"The exercise was pretty simple. 
It did not require much movement, other than the neck. 
For example, one can do it while sitting and at any time of the day. 
The pictures of the exercise helps the viewer know how to do the exercise. 
I don't think that there were specific instructions on how long the exercise has to be done for. "
"The exercise is excellent for relaxing the neck, which usually holds a lot of tension. I did not realize that my neck was actually a little sore until I actually did the exercise, and after I did it I felt more relaxed. The exercises were easy to do and did not require any equipment, which means they can be done anywhere, at any time. The diagrams explained the exercise fairly well. I think most people have done this exercise at some point, specifically if they work out regularly. To someone who is not already familiar with the movement, it may be helpful to provide a written explanation of how far someone should stretch and for how long. Overall, the diagrams were helpful and the exercise served to relax some muscle tension. "
"The exercise was illustrated in a way that was very clear to replicate and understand.
-as The exercise was performed, certain alleviation was felt and that made me want to do The exercise again and again and share with others.
-The simplicity of The exercise also kept me engaged when It came to actually doing it."
"I liked the exercise as it is a part of the body I would not usually work on but it definitely must be stretched. I sometimes don't realize how much the neck is used and therefore following this exercise felt good and it is something I will definitely do again. Also, the images were very clear and easy to follow. I sometimes feel that when the pictures or instructions are too complex it is hard to follow and therefore demotivates me. Yet, this one was easy to follow. "
"The neck exercise helps relax and stretch your neck muscles. 
Would be better if it illustrated what we are supposed to do with the rest of our body while we are doing this exercise. 
An end state or objective for this exercise will be helpful as well."
"The exercise is enjoyable.
- The drawing is very effective.
- alleviates neck pain and back pain.
- It is not clear how much stress One should put on each movement/
- i will tell my friends about This exercise.
- i do This exercise often.
- It is One of The best exercises."
"The exercise was very relaxing
-i definitely want to try This exercise on More nights when i study
-It would be great to have More exercises for different parts of The body (especially upper back)
-The drawings were clear
-The exercise was simple and easy to copy
-The exercise made my neck feel better After It was completed
-i think The explanation/pictures were engaging
-Sound explanation might also be good in case The pictures are not clear to anybody"
"1. The exercise was very relaxing and effective to reduce shoulder tension and stress.
2. The drawings were helpful to guide inexperienced people with the exercise.
3. The pictures were simple and clear.
4. A very good exercise to alleviate body and to change posture.
5. The drawings were a little confusing as they were not numbered and did not really show flow.
6. Words could have accompanied the drawings to better explain the exercises as it did not specify any risk of injury if done inappropriately (eg. do not use excessively forceful or jerky movements).
"
"The neck exercise were very relaxing and are very helpful for student who sits and read for a long day. I will recommend putting the picture of the exercise in a sequence. Moreover, it will be more engaging if the instruction was a gif file, which makes it more easily understood. I also wonder if there is a set to the exercise. May there could be some more detail instruction regarding the exercise."
"here is my review:

- The excercise is very relaxing since it cracks the neck aliviating the pressure

- The drawings helped to understand the excercise easily

-The excercise is boring but helps 

- Very easy to do and repeat

-Maybe it should show how many time each excercise

-Some text might've been helpful

- Not very innovative since I was doing this when I opened the survey"
"The excercise is good for bringing circulation back for a stiff neck.
Does a good job engaging all of the neck.
Very simple and easy to do
Instructions were clear and concise
Can be done anywhere without any equipment
Very quick excercise as well
Can be accompanied by another mini excercise for a full experience
Verbal instructions can help but isnt necccesary,"
I did not like the exercise. I think anything to do with stretching and rotating the neck can be detrimental. I think maybe it could be effective under proper supervision. The exercise just made me dizzy. I think more instructions are important to give due to the uncertainty that comes with neck movements. It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go tilting one's head. The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal direction to make the exercise more effective.Maybe there should be an explanation of benefits. 
"Cracking of the neck joints is unhealthy. Such cracking could cause arthritis in the future. Is it unclear if the pictures indicate a person should stretch or crack their necks. Stretching, on the other hand, is healthy and should be done with 2-5 lb weight in the opposite side of the neck you are stretching. Participants should engage in different variations of yoga to assist in posture on a regular basis. "
"The direction to move your neck was unclear. 
The drawing was effective in showing what body parts to move.
It is not clear how much tension one should put on the neck when doing the exercise.
It is not clear how long one should rotate their neck around for.
This picture does persuade me to want to engage in the exercise.
"
"I feel like this exercise isn't a very good one. It does't engage many muscle groups. There isn't much need for people to do neck exercise unless they play a sport like football or wrestling, so this seems useless. The diagram is clear. I feel like they could use some verbal directions or suggestion of reps. "
"this exercise is actually bad for your neck, you should never strain your neck backwards
this exercise was relaxing
you can do this exercise anywhere
this exercise is not super useful for the average person
if your neck is strained and you need a good stretch this exercise is good"
"The exercises engages you neck.
-The drawings are easy to follow as It is a common exercise.
-if you are only looking to exercise you neck It is a good exercise.
-It does not encompass The shoulders which is a body part that often aches.
-The drawings are simple and clear.
-There should be a note not to stretch It too far.
-people may swing their neck around too aggressively.
-i am overall satisfied with The drawings of The exercise."
"This exercise was very basic. It didn't feel particularly exciting to stretch this way. This is something I typically do though, so I suppose it's necessary. It's something I would do when necessary."
The drawing was effective. They could have used a video or audio. The exercise was not very engaging. It was easy. It was a warm up. It's not clear how hard the exercise was supposed to be. It was unclear how many times I was supposed to do the movement. 
"The drawings should firstly be accompanied with some verbal directions, to make it more clear. Conor may also give a better representation and description of the exercise. The degree to which you complete the exercise, such as the amount of neck movement, is also unclear: this would need some direction. This particular exercise is very simple and not straining or taxing, and so is relatively easy to complete. Neck movements are not the best exercises, but are convenient and can be completed anywhere and at pretty much any time."
The exercise seems like an exercise you would do to stretch you neck. Based on the image of the exercise or not sure if I would do it or not. I have seen people to the exercise before but I wouldn't go out of my way do to the exercise. 
"-very clear description
-seems very invigorating
-i feel like i'd get a lot out of this exercise"
The exercise was simple and concise. The movements allowed for flexibility on how the person wished to perform them. The exercise didnt provide for how long one should do the exercise. The exercise should have a description explaining what it works. The exercise should include a short video demonstration. The demonstration didnt state the pressure that should be provided on the neck
"The exercise is quite boring.
I have done it before and its not my favourite option. 
However I think it might be an OK exercise to do. 
I actually see this exercise more like a way to stretch. 
The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. 
I also think people should know how to properly do this exercise.
Doing other exercises could be a better option.
Im not sure this exercise is engaging."
I did not like it. It hurt me. I wish I did not have to do this activity. My physical health isn't all the great honestly. It's okay though because thats life.
The exercise had a clear description of how to perform it correctly. It's not clear how quickly they should do the exercise. It's not as clear how how much stress should be involved in the movements. I think there should be verbal directions to direct the exercise a little more. i think the images should be numbered as well as to which order they should be performed in. The exercise is engaging but not sure how effective it is.
"The excessive in engaging.
The simplistic photos were easy to understand, although perhaps a moving illustration of the excessive would be more engaging.
The neck muscles are definitely affected in posture and should be treated.
More excersised are necessary for a full program including the back and shoulder muscles.
It should be stated how much time each position is held for.
"
The exercise was a good exercise. The picture showed a clear message of what a person should do. but at the same time i found the exercise to be pointless as it does not benefit any part of the body. 
"The exercise is relaxing if you do it to the end
It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how much of the exercise should be done
The drawings could be in video form to show exactly what needs to be done
The exercise is easy to do and makes you feel relaxed or comfortable
The drawings show the neck only and we use consider other body parts such as the back
"
"The pictures are helpful in guiding the exercise. It is helpful in relaxing the neck. It is very simple and easy to complete. The word exercise can imply calorie-burning, which this particular exercise does not seem to do. The degree to which one should commit to the exercise is unspecified. This may not be an exercise someone wants to do in a public setting."
"The exercise did not really help relax the neck.
Additional exercises for the back accompanied with this one for the neck would've helped
A video demonstration would have been useful

"
"images were okay. 
a video might be helpful. 
more engagement might be cool. 
unclear why we did it. 
more background info might be good. "
The picture was simple to understand. The exercice was easy to reproduce. The exercice was not very exciting. The exercice was not hurtful. The picture could be replaced by a video.
"The exercise is not engaging and it does not encourages you to do it at the end. In terms of picture quality, the drawing should be more complex. I would focus more on other other parts of the body where exercise is more effective like legs or the back. The drawings should come with better verbal explanations. I would not repeat the exercise again. I would not recommend it to other people. It is not clear how much stress is relieved through this exercise. I will try different exercises in the future."
"what is important in for a good and posture
"
i thought it was ok.. but it hurt a bit and wasnt bery useful
"The exercise is very commonly used and I find it effective. It was relaxing to my neck but also helped the tension in my shoulder blades from slouching. It would be nice to have an exercise that incorporates my lower back and shoulders too. There should be verbal directions. It would be nice to have specifications on repetitions. There should also be time specifications as well. I feel like this is also a very common exercise, so I would like to learn about a new alternative for stretching. "
the drawings were clear however to attain utmost comfort one must also excerice the shoulders and back
I liked the exercise. It made me feel more relaxed. It really stretched out my neck and back. I would like to do more for my back.
"The exercise was relaxing. The simplistic drawing was clear enough to describe the exercise. Although the exercise was relaxing, it did not really encourage me to do more at the end. Additional drawings for back would be more useful. "
The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do it to the end. The simplistic drawings are very effective and easy to follow. It is not clear how long one should hold the movements for. The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal direction to clarify duration of the movements. The exercise helped relieve tension in the neck. The exercise was a nice break from doing static work. The exercise focused only on the neck. Standing up would be beneficial in helping people relax.
"Although the exercise is demonstrated with minimalism, the sheer austerity of the diagrams leaves much to interpretation. As a methodical person, I prefer a broad instruction of the proper routine or pattern displayed first, then followed by the individual steps which comprise the exercise. Not only were the images out of order, so to speak, but they also lacked any definitive parameters to guide the exercise. Usually, specific regimens indicate a duration to hold any given position, as well as a recommended number of repetitions. Without any description of the format and suggested exercise pattern, I'm unlikely to continue with this exercise. As a consumer, I prefer products which clearly indicate their benefits, to those with vague images. Particularly with anything pertaining specifically to the body, I look for scientific justifications to a product's success. While full of potential, this exercise's current presentation feels haphazard and amateur."
"A video of each part of the exercise could be helpful to people who are not used to practicing these kind of neck stretches. 
The exercise is good because it can be done quickly and does not require any extensive movements.
It is not easy for beginners to know how much strain to do, how often to do the exercise etc. "
The exercise was simple and practical to do in any circumstance. 
"This exercise is engaging and does provide a level of relief. 
Picture quality is effective but I believe the order of images could be clearer. For example, separated by exercise a little more or numbered
Some text explanation might be helpful. For example, how many times should I do certain exercise.
Reminded frequency for exercises would be helpful.
Should one hold the position for a certain amount of time before switching or moving?
How long should each next circle take?"
The diagrams were easy to understand. The exercise definitely helped my neck. I enjoyed doing this exercise. I wish there's was a video diagram as well. Additionally diagrams to help other parts of the body would be great.  
"The exercise was easy to follow based on the images provided. However, it was fairly simple and didn't really engage me (the user). It's an exercise that is easy enough that I would remember, and use it, if I got a pain in my neck, but I would not use it frequently. I guess if there was one thing that would need more clarification, I would chose the number of reps to do of each movement. I would also recommend adding some additional exercises to create an entire routine so that the user can actually focus/engage in the act of exercising and relax. For those exercises, if they incorporate other parts of the body, I would highly recommend adding a written set of instructions to help interpret the images."
"The exercise should have somer verbal directions. It was a relaxing exercise.
It is a good exercise to do when you feel stressed.
It is an easy exercise, so most of people will do until The end.
It is not very clear how far one should go tilting"
"The exercise, overall, was enjoyable. The motion was relaxing and relieved tension. I did feel the illustrations were not as clear as they could be. I did not know, for example, how quickly to execute the movement or for how long. Verbal directions could have helped. Written instructions also could have been of assistance. Though it was enjoyable, it was not memorable or unique. I wouldn't talk about it with a friend."
"The exercise was definitely engaging because it worked the kinks out of my neck. The diagram was also simple, yet effective and easy to follow along. Because they were no other elements to the exercise beside the neck rotation, it was hard to make a mistake. The one problem was knowing how much to move my neck, but that was really a matter of preference. While it would be made that much easier if the drawings had written directions, they weren't really necessary. "
"The exercise is simple and easy, but this lack of complexity makes it less engaging.
The drawing is a bit unclear at times.
Accompanying written instructions would make the drawing more effective.
"
"The exercise would work better with a video or animated gif to accompany it. The exercise is comfortable but the researchers should provide instructions on if it needs to be done while sitting up straight or standing, etc. Some parts of the drawing were unclear. The exercise should specify how many times it should be done, if it should be done in both directions, etc. Additional drawings for other parts of the body would be nice as well."
The exercise is okay. It's good for just stretching in the morning and won't be a great exercise if one is trying to lose weight or relax.
"The photos in the exercise were simple enough to follow directions. The exercise is simple enough for anyone to do anywhere. The photos were a nice touch, but it would have been helpful to have a number of rounds for people to do, or even adding the benefits of the exercise. I know it was good for me and my body, but the exact reasons why would be a nice touch. This is an exercise that any person can do. "
The exercise was simple to follow. The drawing were very clear. It was not specified how long one was supposed to spend on each exercise. It was not mentioned how often one should do it in order to maximize returns. The exercise is simple to replicate and teach others. It is also convenient to be used in any situation. It is not specified how this will affect your health. 
"I like the way the exercise has been shown with the use of pictures to help explain the steps.
It's easy to do and can be done anywhere.
It can hurt sometimes as well if it is done too hard.
"
"The exercise is relaxing. It helps to loosen your neck. It would help to have a short video of someone doing this exercise. Its unclear how fast it is to do this exercise. If done right, the exercise can relieve stress. The drawings were pretty clear. After doing the exercise, I feel less stressed. I enjoyed the exercise."
"The exercise is easy to perform.
a positive component of The exercise is that It does not require any additional materials or equipment.
It is unclear how long This exercise is supposed to be done for in total.
It is unclear if we are supposed to chan"
"I thought that the exercise was engaging physically and mentally.  I felt relaxed while following through with the motions.  I have done this exercise before, therefore I had a clear understanding of what I had to do as well as what was expected from it.  Afterwards I felt a nice stretch in my neck, as well as more relaxed and able to feel less tension.  The demonstration shown was easily explained and could be interpreted well. "
"The simplistic drawing is effective
it is not clear how much stress should be put on each movement"
the exercise was good. it made my neck feel like it was being stretched. it was clear how to do the exercise. it was easy to imitate the images that prompted the exercise. 
"The statement that it is not clear how much stress should be put on each movement (and how far) is the closest to my interpretation of the exercise. Additionally, there is not any indication as to the repetition or duration of the exercise. An individual can strain their neck or become injured if they do not understand the difference between normal stretching and mobility versus straining. In general, the neck is too significant an area to exercise with the guidance of a simple drawing without clear instruction. "
"I think there is more direction needed for the exercise. How far should I be turning my head to each side. How slowly should I be revolving my head. Whether or not I need to squeeze or loosen any other muscle groups. The exercise is rather comforting, and relaxing. However, I do wonder if it's actually all that beneficial for my neck. So while it's slightly enjoyable and relaxing to do, how good is it for me and how am I really supposed to be doing it."
"The exercise was a familiar one, so I already knew what to do. On top of that instructions were pretty clear. I was uncertain if the exercise was intended to be repeated a few times or just meant to do once. The action itself was helpful in relaxing. I spend a lot of time seated, so posture stretches are really necessary. I liked how I could really feel my spine stretching out. It was not challenging or strenuous, so some people could confuse this exercise with their own definition and expectation of exercise."
"Unlike competitive sports, this exercise does not require any skills. For a relaxation exercise, this is probably the best part. Students nowadays spend a lot of time in front of their laptops. Learning this exercise and try it out during break time is quite beneficial. Based on my experience just now, it does relax my muscle on my neck."
"The exercise is effective in doing what it is meant to do (stretch the neck).
It is useful and applicable to all demographics of people, to help better their posture.
The depictions are helpful in understanding what movements to complete.
Pictures could use some sort of description to enhance exercise.
They could also let us know how long to hold each position for.
Could also tell us how many reps per movement to do.
An explanation of the benefits this exercise is could prompt more effort.
Suggestions on more advanced or beginner alternatives in case the person doing the exercise is not benefiting from such movements or unable to perform them due to injury or other reasons."
"This exercise is easy to do,and helps release some pressure in your neck."
"The exercise is engaging and not complex
The exercise is not difficult but tidies 
In terms of quality it has quality 
It is more effective than other exercises 
"
It is true that each movement needs to specify more how far one should tilt one's head. I knew it because I have done this exercise many times.
"The basic movements of this exercise shown in drawing  are very easy and understanable. 
The exercise is not so engaging because the movement is dry and monotonous. 
The drwaing should be demonstrated with verbal directions. 
The exercise is helpful and useful  for people who need to sit at long time facing the computer in front of them to protect their cervical health.
The exercise is comforting, helping people to release pressure and fatigue.
The drawings needs direction arrows.
It is not clear that how much times people should do with each movement and how long the exercise will take. 
 In order to protect the health of people who sit in front of the computer at long time, only the the exercise for cervical is not enough. The exercise for shoulder and lumbar are also needed.

"
"The exercise made me relaxed, it is not difficult to do. The drawings are clear enough to understand. It would be better to add some words for explaining. I do not know the advantages of this exercise. The picture is interesting and qualitative. The drawing should have some words to make it more effective. The drawings are too simple, more details can make it better. "
"The pictures given for the exercise were simplistic, allowing it to be easily recreated. The actions helped to stretch out the muscles in my neck. It also helped to relax my muscles and my mind. The neck can hold a lot of stress, so exercises such as this one and others are very important in relieving some of that stress. It was slightly unclear from the pictures how long you are supposed to hold each position. It was also a little unclear how many times you should repeat the entire circuit. Overall, I think an exercise such as this one is very helpful for college students. I would be interested in trying out other exercises like this one."
The exercise is simple and can easily and been done in a public setting such as university or workplace without attracting too much attention. The exercise is relaxing and the drawing was a clear instruction on how to do the exercise. A small video could also help to explain the steps and would be more engaging than a drawing 
"The picture quality was clear in terms of movements; however, the order of the movements could have been better indicated. Some time or pace indications would be helpful for performing the exercise. Indicating the body position (i.e. standing, sitting) would also be helpful to the participant. The exercise was easy to do. The exercise helped stretch my neck. It was not clear how much stress to put into each movement, but no body works the same so each participant could judge the amount of stress needed on his or her own. Some written directions would be helpful. This exercise could be dangerous to a novice who has not performed neck exercises before or does not perform them often."
The exercise is very easy to understand. The exercise is a common stretching technique. The exercise does not take a long time to complete. The exercise is effective in the middle of the day. The exercise would make me feel more relaxed. The exercise is well described by the picture. The exercise is something I wouldn't mind doing at my desk. The exercise would make me feel better. 
"The exercise is simple enough that most people should be able to complete it. The drawings were clear but it was unclear how far the neck should stretch. It could be easy to hyperextend the muscles by accident and hurt the neck instead of help it. If there were additional directions it would be more clear how much the neck should be stretched. Also, it was unclear how many times the exercise should have been repeated. It seems as if one time would not be sufficient but if the exercise was completed too many times it could hurt the neck. Overall though the drawings were clear and the exercise was effective. The directions just need to be a little more specific. "
"The drawings were not fully clear. I wasn't sure if I should read it side to side like a book, or up and down. The left side of the drawing seemed to be saying to nod your head back and forth, but the right side said to roll your head around in a circle. Also I don't think it's clear that you have to roll your head in both directions. The exercise does not say how many times you should roll your head so I do not know exactly when it ends. Verbal directions would be very helpful. Doesn't have to be a paragraph but just a couple bullet points. "
The exercise was good because it had a clear visual instructions which helped to complete the exercise. Having those visual instructions also engaged me and allowed for me to make sure that I was doing exercise correctly. The exercise itself was relaxing and allowed me to stretch out my neck and relax my shoulders. The feeling stretching out my neck showed me how tense they were and maybe want to do more exercises. Commonly if someone has back problems also have back problems. Having more exercises with visual representations would be nice. Maybe even adding in video instead of just pictorial instructions could make the exercise even more engaging.
"This exercise is comfortable. 
It is easy to do anywhere with very little time. 
It offered freedom to the person to stretch as far as is comfortable.
The drawings were fairly clear.
Needed more clarification on how the rest of the body should be positioned.
Needed more clarification on how many repetitions to do.
Figure looked male, why? why not female?
Arrows were helpful for directions."
"Unsure on how many times you should do it
Should you push yourself more in certain tilts of the head
Is there a breathing recommendation to go with it 
Is it more effective in the morning or night time? 
Should I go from the left side 1st then the right or vice versa?
Should it be accompanied by other exercises?
What effect does it have long-term?
Is this considered the most effective form of neck exercise?"
"I found the exercise to be very relaxing and calming. The pictures were clear to me in conveying the movement of the exercise. But the picture could be made clearer in terms of the order of the movements. Perhaps if they numbered the movements it could be more concise. Alternatively, making a GIF of the movements or a video could be very helpful as well. Giving more background knowledge on the purpose and effects of the exercise could be useful information for the participant too. Personally, I like to know the science behind different exercises and how they affect my body. "
"because i already knew The exercise beforehand i had no issues doing This exercise, but for others who havent done It, It may be difficult to follow
- More interactive features such as a video demonstration or animation would make The exercise More comprehensible
- The exercise was simple and easy to follow
- It is not clear how many rotations and The degree of stress we should put on our next
-The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make The exercise More effective
- in terms of picture quality, The drawing is too simplistic
- a step by step description should accompany The picture
- Information about how The exercise influences posture would be helpful."
The exercise is easy to do. The directions are a little unclear though at first because the pictures aren't in the correct order. The picture with the arrow was the most clear. It was also unclear how many times I should do the exercise. This could be clarified by adding a few sentences or bullet points under the picture. Additionally some other exercises for the neck or back would be helpful. 
"The drawings accurately portrayed the motion.
I had done this exercise before, so the pictures were a clear reminder of the move.
If i had never done this move before, it may not have been enough instruction for me to do it correctly.
For the exercise itself, it was very relaxing and worked my neck muscles properly.
The instructions could have given more direction in terms of speed of the movement, 
Was unsure how much muscle tension was supposed to be held.
A video could have made it the movement clearer
Some audio with more explicit instructions than pictures could have also accomplished this.
"
"The drawings are the wrong way to go, that is how people get hurt when exercising.
A video demonstrating the exercise is clearly the best solution.
The drawing looks as if it was taken out of a middle school health book.
The exercise is great though, very relaxing on the neck.
The picture and video are actually unneeded because I think this is just how everyone in the world stretches their neck anyway.
Also why are there no eyes on the drawing, it places unrealistic body goals on middle school health students everywhere."
"The picture is straightforward and easy to follow. It didn't illustrate any weird or crazy neck movements so I thought I'd try it. These are exercises I would probably do anyway without being prompted after sitting in a weird position for a while. I think the pictures are more effective than trying to describe the action with written or spoken words. I would call these actions stretches rather than exercises. I think it's clear that you should follow the motions illustrated in ways that feel good rather than straining yourself. If i saw this posted somewhere like in the library where i've been sitting for a while, i'd probably try them out. "
"The exercise is engaging and can help relieve neck pain from sitting and looking down at a book or laptop. The drawings of the exercise were very clear and easy to follow. It would be nice if the exercise was accompanied by a series of other exercises to improve posture and release pressure that might be put on the neck and back. Before seeing this exercise, I had already done it to help with a stiff neck. It would also be helpful to maybe have a note at the bottom of the drawing that instructs how many times someone should do the exercise. The note should also state that one should role their neck slowly. Doing so would prevent any further injury. The picture does encourage the reader to do the exercise.  I would encourage others to do the exercise as well. "
"The exercise is simple to perform
The drawings help to explain how to complete the exercise. 
A video would make it easier to understand what to do. 
This exercise could be strengthened by the use of other body parts such as simultaneous stretching of the arms or legs. 
This exercise does not seem innovative. 
A recommended time should be provided.
The drawing could be in color to be engaging. 
Speed of the motion is hard to discern from the drawing. "
This exercise is engaging as it incorporates both visuals and text. I think that the images used were visually appealing. The visuals were high in quality and colourful. Some of the questions were repetitive. It was not clear about the moral aspect or ethics about some of the questions. This exercise was quick and easy to follow. It was unclear as to how much stress one should put on each movement. The drawings should include captions. 
"The exercise is easy.
The exercise is relaxing. 
The exercise helps release tension in the neck. 
The exercise is intuitive so the drawings and instructions made sense.
Many people have done this exercise before."
"The exercise seemed engaging and useful to incorporate into everyone's daily life. The drawings of the exercise were effective in demonstrating the motions involved. They were like a lot like other diagrams of exercises and stretches depicted on exercise machines and posters in gyms, so the familiarity helped me understand the movements a lot faster. The simple drawings made it clear which area of the body the exercise was targeting. It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement, how far one should tilt their head, and how long the stretch should be held. A short description below the images may assist in further comprehension of movements. "
"The exercise was very relaxing, having done the exercise before I only needed to reference the picture slightly. I had no problems in understanding to how to perform the exercise. It was unclear though how much pressure to put in each aspect of the exercise. Some other indication (audio, verbal) could have been useful to perform the exercise even better. "
I like to participate in exercise that involves both cardiovascular and strength exercises. Boxing is a prefect example. Boxing works that cardio a and increases your strength as well. It also shapes the body very well and improves coordination. I do not like excesses that hurt the body and that negatively impact the joints and bones. 
"The exercise was simple
The exercise was short
The exercise was for the neck"
Exercise makes me feel good. Varying from exercise to exercise is what makes it interesting. I do not like doing the same things over and over again. There is no need for verbal directions if the pictures are well drawn and show the full description of the exercise.
"The image could have been better. I already knew the exercise so I did not need to rely on the image, but many people might need the image to properly understand and perform the neck exercise."
"It is not clear how much stress should be out into each movement
It is sometimes not comfortable at all
Even though it is not the most comfortable, you will feel relaxed at the end
The exercise would help your physical health
The picture is pretty clear about what should be done
I would recommend the exercise to friends
I would maybe repeat the exercise"
"The exercise is simple and easy to do
- i have done This exercise very often in The past
-The drawing is very helpful to illustrate The exercise
- had no difficulty interpreting The drawing
-The Illustration is similar to ones i have seen before"
"- The drawings were very clear in explaining on how to do the exercise.
- It is not as clear how slowly and how stretched you have to move your neck.
- The exercise was not necessarily engaging or ""interesting"" to do
- The exercise definitely relieved my "
The photos were very clear. I understood how to do all aspects of the exercise. The exercise was engaging. I felt relaxed and rejuvenated. The drawings were simplistic and thus easily understood. I was engaged in the activity. I will probably complete the exercise again. 
"The drawing did a fair job of depicting the exercise. The arrows gave pretty clear direction of which way the neck should move. This exercise was sort of effective, since I did feel some cracking in my neck and felt a bit more relaxed once the exercise was completed. I did not feel as though this exercise did a thorough job of exercising areas other than my neck, as my shoulders and back still felt unaffected afterwards. Some verbal direction could always be helpful, though the exercise was simple enough to be accurately explained by the pictures."
I have previously done this stretch before so it was very intuitive for me to understand what the diagrams and instructions were showing me. 
"I believe these variations of stretching exercises of neck are very engaging and can be performed by anyone without any age barrier (as these are very simple to follow).
 As there is essentially no equipment required this can be performed while sitting down on the desk. One doesn't require an area as much as a full body workout. 
This is imperative that other body parts play a vital role for a good posture however as neck muscles tend to get more tense in sedentary occupations, these exercise will likely ease the tension.  
However the exercise was very brief. There should be further directions how to perform them in sets and particular repetitions to engage it's effectiveness.
Since neck muscles are used as a secondary muscle group in many exercises such as pushups, squats or pull-ups, and using primary muscle groups is likely to enhance postures.
Not everyone is the same. And not every one has similar fitness levels. These exercise are catering the needs for most beginners.  However there could be much more variations to this for advance or intermediate users."
"The drawings were clear and effective
It was encouraging
Not clear how much stress to put on each side and how much time to do it for
the number of rotations required were not mentioned 
it was a good stretch 
"
My exercise aligns with the statements above. It was clear what parts of the body benefitted from this exercise. It was relaxing and calming to perform the exercise. I can see the benefits already of doing this on a daily to weekly basis. I am curious as to what other exercises are similar in effect. 
"This exercise wasn't very comfortable. I think it might do more harm in the long run rather than be helpful. It really is only good for getting kinks out of your neck. It is very similar to how we crack our knuckles. The creator of this exercise should warn people to take their time with it so they don't do that. I would much prefer an exercise that incorporates the neck, back, shoulders and legs. Having an all encompassing exercise like that would be great for posture. This exercise only focuses on the neck, which is only a small makeup of posture. "
This exercise is a good way to limber up the neck and relax after sitting for a long period of time. It takes very little time to complete. The picture quality clearly illustrates the method required to do the exercise. Anyone can do this exercise. People should take more time to do similar exercises to relax. 
"The exercises were easy to understand and do. There was no time or repetition indication, so I was not sure how long to do each exercise. The simplistic drawings are very effective, but should be numbered or split up better because it is overwhelming upon first glance. The first vertical exercise was confusing because I was trying to read left to right. There should be additional exercises included to exercise the back and shoulders. "
"The drawing to perform this exercise was very simple and clear to follow. In fact, this exercise is one that I perform often especially if I have been working on my laptop for too long. It helps me relieve tension on my neck and shoulders and makes me feel more relaxed. Because it is an exercise I practice regularly, I had no difficulty understanding the drawing. I do agree that this exercise is engaging and it encourages to do it for the very end. "
"- This exercise is easy to do 
- This exercise is east to understand 
- This exercise doesn't not take too much time 
- This exercise is not time consuming 
- This exercise can be done by anyone
- This exercise can be incorporated easily into someone's sc"
"The drawings were very clear.
I've seen and done this exercise before so I recognized it immediately once I saw the picture. This type of exercise helps me release stress and tension in specific areas. 
I find it very useful because of the satisfactory feeling afterwards.
It is an exercise I do quite often.
Its simplicity makes me want to keep doing it.
"
"Depending of who the audience is for this exercise, it could be accompanied by minimal instructions. E.g. elderly subjects could have difficulty in understanding the instructions.
To someone who has performed the exercise before it is easy to execute, however, to someone who has never done this before it can be slightly confusing. 
This exercise is simple, which means that subjects from a wide range of demographics can be used. 

"
"The exercise is simple, and easy to do wherever you are. It requires very minimal movement, yet relaxes and calms the body. 
The drawings were very clear, but did require further detail in terms of how much time is needed conducting the exercises. "
"- The exercise is very relaxing and relieves stress. 
- The third picture was unclear of which direction to move my head but I figured it didn't matter.
- I would recommend this exercise to friends.
- I will try to remember to do this exercise as often as"
"This exercise is mostly great for stretching the neck, shoulders, and upper back area. I have done this exercise before and enjoy the relaxing stretch of it to relieve stress. The drawings were great to demonstrate the exercise. I think the drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. Telling people to breathe while they do this exercise or sharing little tips on how to deepen this stretch will be more beneficial. For example, when you put your head down and use your hands to press on the back of your head, relaxing the shoulders will help deepen the stretch. Even sharing an extension of this exercise with rotating the shoulders with the head can provide more insight to this exercise. "
"The exercise is engaging for anyone to complete. It has benefits to improving mood, relieving tension, and strengthening/stretching the neck and back. A video demonstration could prove beneficial to those who have not done the exercise before. Number of repetitions could also aid in the viewer to receive the most out of the exercise."
The exercise can be done when you are stressed to relax you. The exercise is simple and easy to do anywhere. The exercise is easy to remember and teach others. This exercise helps automatically correct you from defaulted posture. This exercise not only affects your neck but also your spinal chord. This exercise helps you crack faults in your neck bones. This exercise is addictive and you want to do it again. This exercise wakes you up. This exercise is a good substitute for a massage. 
The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do it to the end. I even told my friend that was sitting next to me to do it. It made me feel good and stretch. I might do it more often when im sitting in my computer 
This exercise is engaging and feels great. It's a productive stretch in helping to loosen neck muscles. This exercise also proves to be beneficial. I thought the drawings were somewhat clear in representing how to accomplish this exercise. Instructions for each step may help in clarification for those who have never seen this exercise. I believe that this is a simple stretch that can assist in improving posture and neck soreness. 
I think this exercise is very useful because it helps me to relax. It is also very engaging because it is easy to do. 
"The exercise is very helpful and easy to implement. However, I suggest adding how much time we need to exercise in the picture because I do not the most effective time to do it."
"The pictures are clear and most people have done these exercises at one point in their lives.

Textual instructions could be helpful to clarify how much effort/stress one should put into each movement.

This is a pretty simple exercise and should not be over complicated.

There should be instructions above the picture that read ""Please perform the exercise depicted below now""

There should qualifying statement that indicates that participants should only perform the exercise to their own ability and not to hurt themselves. 

I am confused about the purpose of this survey; am I supposed to be analyzing the effectiveness of the instructions or of the exercise itself. 


"
"The pictures were easy to follow and replicate. I had previous experience with this exercise from stretching in gym class, so that may have made doing the actions easier. The prompt should have included some benefits from doing the exercise to encourage participation. Also, encouraging the participant to do the exercise help the person get up from the laptop. I agree that some of the directions were vague as to how much pressure should be applied or the direction of the rotation. However, it is up to the person's ability to do the level of intensity. For a more cohesive exercise illustration, there should be words under each step of the exercise."
"The images of The exercises were clear.
- The exercise is not innovative.
- The images could provide word instructions to make The exercise clearer.
- The steps should be enumerated.
- The exercise was pretty relaxing.
- should clarify The force on each movement.
- should clarify The directions of each movement.
- should clarify how The other body parts have to be positioned."
"This exercise is short enough to make you do it until the end.
The drawings are simplistic enough for anyone who wants to participate in such an exercise.
More drawings like that for the rest of the body would be of great use to me.
I felt more relaxed after this exercise.
"
"The simplistic drawing is very effective; however, I am not sure about the sequence of action.It will be better to mark with number. In addition, it will good if there is vocal or writing instruction which can increase the participant's engagement and exercise effiency. Without those instruction, it's hard for participants control the stress they use. How to create a easy but simple instruction is critical. Overall, it is good exercise. First, it is easy to do so. Second, eyes can also take break when we're doing neck relaxing. "
The exercise is engaging and encourages me to do it to the end 
this exercise is very relaxing and help me stress my body.
"The drawings were really clear and easy to follow.
- It made me feel relaxed and helped me release stress.
- some verbal direction could be helpful but not needed in my case.
- i will definitely practice This exercise everyday.
- i enjoyed It and would love to receive More exercises for The back too."
"I have already done this exercise before but it was enjoyable to do it again
the drawing only took a quick glance to figure out what to do 
my neck actually kind of hurts after doing the exercise 
it would be helpful to have some words accompanying the pictures
it didnt really help the part of my neck that actually hurts which is where the spine starts

"
"        I think this exercise is really good for relaxing neck. 
        The drawing of the exercise is easy to learn and to follow.
        But maybe a video example is better.
        I prefer more exercise on neck, because this one is kind of easy.
        The exercise should be more comprehensive including the back, the shoulders and the legs.
        Students should have whole body exercise.
        I think this exercise can be introduce to more people.
        Such as white collar work in offices.
        
         "
"The exercise was very helpful for my neck pain, however the directions were unclear. I knew how to do the exercise prior to receiving the instructions for it. The instructions were choppy. Words would be helpful and it must be stressed to go slowly as to not put your neck at risk for injury."
"The drawing for the exercise was pretty good at demonstrating how to properly execute it.  It could be more helpful if it was accompanied by a short description that said something regarding letting your head naturally roll around as it hangs.  This is a natural feeling exercise that I feel many people already do without it ever being formally taught to them previously.  I think that the simplistic drawings were good and more complexity is not necessary besides the addition of verbal directions.  The addition of something regarding the benefits of the exercise is crucial too.  I enjoyed this exercise quite a bit.  It was relaxing, loosening, and simple."
"The neck exercise was definitely a positive action to implement in my daily life, as it not only is engages but also encourages to finish it every time you do it. The neck is an essential part of our posture and well being, thus having more pictures and demonstrations of other exercises in the back, shoulders and legs will also be encouraging to better one's practices. However, some images of the exercise were a bit unclear on how to perform them, such as to which direction would we first engage on. Overall, it was not clear how much strength should we put into each movement, and how far are we supposed to tilts our heads; therefore, it would be helpful to have some verbal directions in addition to the drawings to make sure the exercise is performed as correctly. "
The exercise is simple and relaxing. I always do this by myself when I spend too long in front of the computer. I think this exercise can help to protect my neck.
"The picture is unclear, I know how to do it because I have done this exercise before.
The drawing is too simple. 
The exercise itself helps me relax my tight neck.
It will be helpful if it comes with introduction about how many times you should do to get best result. "
"These exercises are imperative in relaxing the body after a stressful day and keeps the person mentally and physically fit. The picture quality effectively demonstrates the movements, however, there could be a video attached to each picture to better execute these respective exercises. As its not very clear how much stress is required on each of the movements and how far one should tilt their head."
"The exercise is engaging and encourages you to do it to the end. It was very easy to follow the picture instructions. You have to be careful about maybe disrupting a nerve or cracking a muscle in your neck. The neck is considered to be the main body parts influenced by one's posture. It is not clear how much time you should put into this exercise. I would recommend doing this exercise once in the morning, in the afternoon, and before you go to bed. "
"I think the picture was pretty self-explanatory. I don't think that additional drawings incorporating the back and the legs are needed. Yes, they involve posture but it is not necessary for the comprehension of the dynamic of the exercise. I do not think that the drawings should be accompanied by verbal directions. Actually, I think this could bring confusion to the picture. All of the parts were clear and the picture, which is a model of what you should do in order to carry out efficiently the exercise, should be how it is right now. "
"The exercise is engaging.
The exercise encourages you to do it to the end.
The drawing are very simplistic and effective.
Additionally drawings would be helpful.
The drawings should be accompanied by some directions.
Some drawings are unclear.
"
"The exercise was incredibly easy to understand, and incredibly simple to execute. I was able to do this exercise in a public location, without feeling strange, and it brought me more comfort and is allowing me to focus on my work. I think there should be more exercises you can make diagrams for that would work on the remainder of your body, and not just the neck."
"This exercise is relaxing.
It allows you to loosen up.
I see it more as a warm up/ stretch.
I wouldn't really do it that often.
It's not clear how much stress you should put on it.
I think its stupid.
Waste of time.
My neck cracked."
"This was painful. 
I was bored. 
My neck hurts. 
I don't like hearing my neck crack.
How can you even consider that an exercise?
Its just putting your neck in really bad spots. 
Do you know what exercise is?
Once again, my neck hurts. 
"
"Um, this is ridiculous. Very poorly written and does never explains what the exercise does, what the exerciser is truly intended for, and who should perform this exercise. Is this meant for beginners or a more experience athlete? Overall this review is bad. "
"I agree with the the writer of some of her points. I do think that the pictures are very effective. Following the pictures people know how to do the exercise. Also , i believe the exercise is very effective when someone want to relax themselves. It is true that the pictures can approve by adding some verbal directions to make it more effective but i think they are very good now."
"I do appreciate the diagram of the photos to describe the exercise. If you move from beginning to end it is pretty understandable. This exercise is only directed at your neck, it would be more helpful to reach other areas of your body. When I'm sitting and doing work for very long the areas that are also affected are my shoulders, and lower back as well. "
The exercise showed understandable neck movements for times when you feel stressed out and when your neck starts to bother you. i have done This exercise before This survey and It has worked for me even as part of my warm up when i start to do some exercises. The aspect that was missing was how many times to make it. also other short and quick exercises for The other body parts would have been helpful.
The exercise wasn't hard. I didn't have a bad time while doing it. Only found out afterward that it's bad for your vertebrae. No longer such a fan of it. 
"Neck circles suck. They are not a good exercise, they hurt my neck and there is no point in doing them. I would never do them. They are not fun. They are not worth my time. I would rather stretch something else."
"The exercise isn't the most comfortable. The only benefit is that is gets kinks out of your neck. I have done this exercise before for that reason. Other than that I think it probably isn't the best way to exercise your neck. It seems like it could have harmful ramifications over time, just as one might expect to have from cracking their knuckles. The exercise might do well to explain to people to take their time with it as to not harm themselves. This exercise also doesn't cover other areas of the body that help with posture. An exercise that included the back, shoulders, and legs would be much more beneficial in my opinion."
"The exercise is brief and easy to complete anywhere. The drawings helped but I was unsure if I did everything in the right order, or if it mattered. Was unsure of how long to hold each position and if I should really feel the stretch of the neck muscles. Overall very relaxing and felt nice, but unsure of what it actually did for me long term or beyond the next three minutes."
"I would like to know more information about the specific muscles the exercise is stretching.
I would also like to know the sequence in which to perform the exercises. 
In addition, I would like to understand how and why this exercise is beneficial to me. 
I would also like suggestions for other exercises to do to complement this one. I am unable to think of 8-10 sentences to write about this exercise. "
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
- The exercises simple enough to understand and simple to follow. 
- It seems like a exercises that everyone has done before thus the picture is easy to understand. For those who haven't done this exercises before, they might not understand just as easy.
- If there are further steps, the founder should mark the steps with numbers and explain each step a little bit. "
"My review of the neck exercise:
I felt a little uncomfortable doing it
I didn't feel any better at the end of it 
The drawing was relatively straightforward, but some of it was ambiguous, like the direction of movement 
Putting my head all the way back hurt a bit 
How often would this be recommended to be done?
But the exercise was simple, so it would be easy to do during the work day
I feel like there needs to be many more exercises to go along with this one to alleviate some of the issues of being at a desk too long "
"This exercise was a very helpful one. It reduced my stress levels. It felt good to loosen my neck muscles after a long day of classes. I have done this exercise before I was prepared. However, others may have not been as prepared as I was. The diagrams may have been confusing to someone who had never done an exercise like this one. It may have been helpful to label the exercise to make it more clear to the viewer. However, the exercise was overall very helpful and relaxing. "
"The exercise is simple to do
It is not something too engaging and exciting
However, it works as a quick stretch when student is in a long study session
The illustrations are self-explanatory.
Arrows for directions in the illustration could have been helpful
I would not particularly follow this exercise. 
I would be likely to find my own stretching position that I find most helpful to my body pain
"
Exercise stretched my neck
"This exercise overall was:
- Simple and quick
-Not sure how effective it really is, my neck feels a bit better
-The drawings for the exercise were a bit confusing, as the direction in which to perform each move was not entirely clear
-Useful in that it reminded me to stretch my neck
-Some sort of chart with steps would be extremely helpful
-A good reminder
-Encourging in that it reminded me to stretch
-Overall, the exercise was engaging but not incredibly helpful"
"While The images of The exercise were helpful, accompanied by a brief demonstrative video would help clarify areas of confusion such as how long to do This for, how fast, how much stress to put on neck, which direction, etc.

what muscles in my neck"
"This is just a regular exercise like the ones you do if your neck hurts, but it is effective. The drawing was good. I did the whole exercise but it did not relax me so maybe it could be more relaxing. I don't think this exercise would be useful for working out."
"I thought the drawings were perfectly clear and easy to follow.
Number of repetitions would be good to know.
I liked all of the exercises EXCEPT for the neck rolling in circles, which I have actually been advised by coaches and my chiropractor never to do. I was taught that this movement actually puts stress on your neck and can cause injury.
I don't really see this as an exercise, more as a stretch. 
This exercise was easy to do, required little expertise.

"
"My review for the neck exercise is as follows:
-It put strain on my neck as I turned my neck around 360 degrees
-My neck is tense as the muscles need more massage
-You need a flexible neck to do these exercises
-It should have a step by step instruction
-Some people have sensitive necks and should be recommended to not engage in it
-It should talk about the purpose of the exercises
-It should say what posture you need to be to make it effective"
"My review:
* The exercise was boring.
* Pictures were clear. Additional pictures might be helpful. 
* Instructions regarding the exercise were clear.
* The instructions regarding this survey were confusing. Additional explanations would be useful.
* I did not get the point of this exercise and survey. "
"this exercise provided relief instantly and allows the blood to flow better 
the drawing was clear and concise making it easy to understand what was to be done
the intensity needed in this exercise was not mentioned and couldn't be read of images
there could have been some verbal help as well 
the back affects the posture as well as allows the blood to flow to the head easily, hence exercises for ones neck is good for the body"
"The exercise helped me stretch the muscles around my neck area and helped tense me. However, the only problem I had was it made me a bit dizzy from all the rotating."
"- the exercise is relaxing.
- the pictures provided explain well what we should do
- however it is not clear for how long we are supposed to do it
- i did it for a few minutes, i feel less stressed now
- outlines should be more specific,we don't know how "
"While the exercise is engaging, it does not seem to be effective. (There is no immediate sense of relief, nor is their necessarily the pain of a good stretch). Rather it seems to irritate the neck while neither helping nor hurting it. Furthermore, the drawings are hard to follow because as a participant there is no direction. I don't know what order I should be following the picture directions in, and there are no guidelines if I am completing the stretch incorrectly. A video and explanation from a doctor of physical therapist would be a much better solution. As a college student, I wish there was an explanation of a weekly routine. How often should I be doing these stretches and how many reps of the same stretch do I need.. when are the best times of day to be doing them and what are the benefits/ time of day?"
"The exercise seems relaxing.
It is low difficulty.
It is more of a stretch than and exercise.
It seems like something that I would just do after hours of time spent in the library."
"there should be more verbal explanations
there should be advanced options
this only works on your neck. it would be nice to have shoulder and lower back exercises. 
i dont know how long i should do the exercise for.
i dont know to what extent i should be putting pressure on my neck."
The exercise is good. It's pretty good. Very useful and all.
"The drawing is somewhat clear. It is clear that you have to move your head in a certain motion but it is unclear as to how much time should be spent in each movement.
Verbal instructions to go along with the image would definitely help.
You do not know whether you are doing the exercise right and.
It would be good to provide the benefits of the exercise and description on how you know you are doing it right. This would improve engagement"
"the exercise felt nice at times but other times it felt tedious and annoying
there were times were my neck cracked and it felt really good
i guess this exercise is better than trying to crack you neck all the time 
i would recommend it to friends"
"The exercise is very simple and easy to do.
The drawing was easy to understand. Maybe a touch of color may make it look a little more interesting.
I think it was good that there were no verbal directions so that non-English speakers can understand the exercise just as clearly.
How much stress one should put on each movement can be problematic. It can cause injuries. 
"
"The pictures are very easy to follow 
The exercise does not require a lot of time and can be done when wanting to take a quick break from working. Instructuns should be written down to help people make sure they are doing it correctly. People could get injured if they put too much pressure/strain on their necks. This is especially so when they rotate their whole head too quickly or with too much force.  "
"I would recommend special benefits be attached to each picture so people with neck problems know what exercice to engage in

Special instructions on how to not pull neck too much, and be slow in movements important not to hurt neck 

Have additional pictures to strengthen neck muscles 

Additional pictures of back exercices, to promote better posture 

Provide additional information on how often should these exercices be done a day to promote better neck health

"
"The exercise is very simple and can be done anymore, not constrained to the gym. 

Simplistic drawing very effective.

Exercise is efficient but should be complemented with other neck exercises for maximum results.

A common exercise done when sitting on the desk without thinking it is an exercise.

Successful in giving tense muscles satisfaction.

Neck is very fragile and should be warned as too much movement too quickly can cause injury."
"The exercise can be done anywhere at anytime
Relieves pain by stretching out the muscles
Can be done in less than 30 seconds, very useful in many situations
Each individual will have different thoughts on this stretch
This could be done every morning right out of bed
The picture displayed for this exercise is very informative, easy to understand"
"This exercise is a simple procedure that relaxes the neck. Afterwards, I had experienced a lessening of my neck's usual stiffness. The images were clear in how to position one's head, but they could have been improved had numbers or additional details been added. Also, the exercise should have indicated how quickly each motion should have been performed, so as to avoid injury. Furthermore, I feel like it had taken multiple repetitions of the exercise to experience any sort of relief."
"This exercise is very basic and well known. I have been taught it before, but rarely use it. However, previous knowledge is what allowed me to figure out what the graphic was trying to tell me to do. The part I got confused about was the middle graphic where the person is looking straight up. Usually I have been taught that exercise as rolling the chin forward before going all the way around back. Further direction as to right/left and how far to tilt your head would probably have been better. If there were words to accompany the picture it would have been nice. I'm not sure why this exercise keeps wanting me to describe it as engaging. It's boring makes me hyper sensitive to how my neck feels and then I can't concentrate on what I'm working on, but I don't really feel a change otherwise, like muscle engagement if that's what it means."
"here is my review of the exercise:
-the exercise is usefull especially if you mantain the same position for a long amount of time
-the exercise can be a litle bit monotonous
-the drawings must have numbers which clarify what to do before and after
-the drawings must been paired with some technical details
-the positive feedback that this exercise give you must be underlined"
I believe the exercise is beneficial to many people that work on a computer and/or sit at a desk. It stretches out and relaxes the muscles and should be implemented in workplaces. It could also be utilized on posters in libraries at universities perhaps. I found the pictures to be simple and easy to follow. But I believe that a write up on how to complete the exercises and why they are beneficial would be useful as well. I could see this information being wide spread and appreciated 
"I agree that the exercise is engaging.  I fell that it is a good way to increase one's level of physical activity when they are sitting for a long period of time.  I would say that the pictures depicting the exercise are very easy to interpret.  However, it would be useful to know more about how far I should be moving my head in a given direction, as well as if I should hold any of the positions for any period of time.  Other than that, the exercise felt like it was useful and a good way to stretch a bit without having to get up.  I also agree with the above review that expanding the exercise to the rest of the back would be beneficial.  As someone who has worse-than-average posture, these types of exercises are appealing.  One other thing I was not sure of was if there is a particular order I should be doing the movements in."
"The neck exercise is similar to exercises that I have done before. While the drawings do demonstrate, using arrows, the ways in which the neck should be moved to received a thorough stretch, there is no textual description of how to do the exercise properly; that fact decreases my overall confidence in the exercise. For example, when moving the head down one's shoulders might slump forward. Is it important to remember to engage the shoulder blades to prevent that from happening? The neck exercise is short, which prompts one to finish it completely. However, it is unclear just exactly how long one should remain in each position to receive the full benefits of the exercise. Overall, the exercise is good, but in dealing with something as important as the neck, needs a lot more description to prevent injury than a simple drawing."
"- the drawings reminded me of Ikea directions, which can be confusing a bit 
- the drawings weren't super clear, i like follow exercises that used gifs 
- I probably would only do this exercise if my neck was sore, I wouldn't do this as a preventative mea"
"This is a simple exercise. It doesn't seem very effective. I also know that you need to be very careful and cautious when exercising your neck, so I would worry that someone may not follow directions and hurt themselves. I do this exercise often when I'm sitting still for too long. I don't see it as a super useful exercise."
"I found the exercise to be very helpful and relaxing. By following the picture I was able to understand what was expected of the exercise. I do believe that further verbal instructions or additional drawing cues would be extremely helpful. The exercise was short in length, which is nice seeing as sometimes exercises take far too long to complete. The exercise was not incredibly complex. This is helpful for a variety of people to be able to understand and perform the exercise. Without additional verbal instruction, it is unclear whether or not the exercise should be repeated or how often the exercise should be done. Overall, this was a relaxing exercise but i do think that further instruction would be beneficial.  "
"The exercise was engaging and I know it helps my neck but I am not sure exactly how or why it helps. It is a very simple and easy exercise to which is nice, I can do anywhere at any time. However, it doesn't involve my full body so I wouldn't use this solely as my exercise, I would need a lot more to feel accomplished. "
"The picture generally explained the exercise, but I am not sure if I simply knew what it was implying because I have done it before. In terms of engagement, this is a very simple and easy exercise to do. Because it is simple, I feel like I do not gain much relaxation or value from it compared to the value I may receive from more intensive stretches. It is also unclear of how fast paced the exercise should be and how long you should do it for. overall, this exercise is of average value, but very simple to do."
"the exercise seemed to be useful and helpful. as people usually try to crack their neck in a bad way with will affect them. these exercises shows you how to do it in a better safe way, that would make you suffer less with neck cramps and ex...

although some drawings were unclear and one would be confused on what exactly is the movement he is suppose to do, but the over all work seem to be straight forwards and direct."
"The neck exercise is common and easy to understand
The instruction is easy to follow
It is useful for people have neck problems
The exercise does not require special hardware to support the exercise
You can do this exercise everywhere any time
 "
"Very simple exercise so can be a good thing (easy to replicate) or bad (doesn't feel revolutionary).
Don't really consider it an exercise since it is things that I feel people do already and know about.
Drawing was a bit strange (movement part) in my opinion.
Didn't really feel like it was the best timing for me to do this exercise.
Although it is a nice and simple exercise, it doesn't feel like it's life-changing.
Still a good start and probably good for really injured people with limited mobility."
"Since I started college I went to the medical center due to my pain in my neck. I did understand this exercise because I am always exercising my neck due to the pain. I do feel some kind of relief but it is not enough.
 "
I do not have knowledge on these types of exercises. But it was nothing special. It was easily to follow from the pictures but maybe not worth getting out of my way to do it. 
"Here is my review for the neck exercise. The exercise is engaging and easy to complete until the end. I think using the pictures to illustrate the exercise is a good and simple idea. However, the exercise could be more clear and concise by adding guiding texts to it. It also should number the movements accordingly so the reader could easily follow. 
"
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:

- The exercise seems a little simplistic and could use more descriptors.
- The simple visual is easy to follow
- Written instructions accompanying the visuals would be helpful
- It was unclear how many times to repeat the exercise
- I didn't feel that the exercise was very engaging.
- The exercise was slightly uncomfortable since I don't often bend my neck in some of those directions.
- It was a quick exercise, which is good.  Something that can be done periodically.
"
"It would be really helpful to be reminded what the exercise looked like. From memory:

-The intent of the exercise was clearly understood from the pictures.
-The exercise was a little unclear on directions; while the motion was understood, extent of motion was not defined
-The exercise should explain what parts of the body are involved; for example, ""you should feel a slight stretch in the sternocleidomastoid, which is the muscle that connects your sternum to your jaw"".
"
"1.The pictures are clear easy to understand.
2. The exercise is really easy.
3. The exercise the do not need too much time, just several seconds.
4. The exercise is easy to memorize.
5. The exercise does not have the requirement for the space.
6. The exercise make me feel relaxed.
7. I feel comfortable about the exercise but I am not sure whether it is usuful or not."
"-I do not think engaging is the right descriptor to use here, personally I don't consider elements like enjoyment or engagement in this circumstances. Exercises are simply means to which you help your body, sometimes it could be effective but not engaging"
"The exercise is simple and easy to understand
The drawing is very easy to comprehend and imitate
There could be more detail about whether the exercise should be done standing or sitting
There could be more detail about how many times to repeat the exercise when doing it for one round
There could be an explanation of how often to do the exercise per day depending on discomfort
The drawings would be better served followed with written instructions
"
"The picture instructions were simple, clear, and easy to follow. Although the instructions were clear, they were definitely basic. I would like more information on an exercise if I plan to do it every day. For example, what are the benefits/ how effective/ how many times to repeat/ how long to hold each neck position?

The exercise itself was easy and soothing. I believe it is too simple to be considered an ""exercise"", since it is really just moving your neck around. 

"
"The exercise is pretty clear but could be a lot more detailed. The drawings were easy to follow, but there wasn't any further instruction regarding details. How many times should you do the exercise? For how long? 
Also I think the exercise is a bit simple, so it might need to have some information on why it's useful or what it does to encourage participants to want to do it more often. "
"1. This exercise is relaxing and stretches muscles that can easily stiffen when sitting at a desk for a long time.

2. Each participant of the exercise can stretch as much or as little as they feel is needed. 

3. The drawings are simplistic but adequately demonstrate how to do the movements. "
"The exercise is comforting but nothing groundbreaking in my opinion. It is an exercise that I have done on my own, and if a professional were to recommend it to me, I would be underwhelmed by their advice. It relaxes me but is unclear how much I am truly relaxed in the long run. The picture and instructions were easy to follow. "
"1. Exercise is very easy to do.
2. Effects are pretty immediate.
3. Easy to follow with diagrams.
4. Might want to put in something about speed at which you move your neck. Obvious, I know, but some people..."
"The neck exercise was repetitive and monotonous, I felt no need to do more than few of the pictured stretches. The picture was simplistic but functional, communicating the information it intended to in a concise manner. The exercise itself caused my muscles in the neck to relax more. "
It is an easy exercise to do in any environment. The movements help stretch out the muscles and feel better. It does not feel like it would a long term solution to the problem. The pain ends up coming back after a few minutes. The drawings made it very easy to understand the exercise. It could have been more detailed in terms f how long each should last. I am likely to do it again
"My review for the neck exercise:
- This exercise is very common.
-I would expect that most people have performed this motion before and would be able to recognize it quickly from the diagram. 
-If by some chance the subject is not familiar with the exercise, I think that the diagrams presented should adequately demonstrate the motion to the subject. 
"
"The exercise did not engage me much.
I agree that the simplistic drawing is effective. It does not, however, need to be drawn from a different perspective.
I do not believe anything in the drawing was unclear.
I do not think the amount of stress exerted matters for this exercise. It is more of a stretch.
The drawings do not need to be accompanied by verbal directions. The picture was clear enough."
"Here is my review for the neck exercises:
-The exercise is easy and engaging
-The picture is easy to follow for the most part
-It is unclear how often I should do the exercise
-It is also unclear as to how effective the exercise is
-I liked that anyone could do this exercise, not just people who are fit
-Overall it was a great exercise!
"
"The exercise was quite relaxing
-The picture quality made The exercise straightforward enough"
"Here is my review for the neck exercise: 
- The exercise is relaxing 
- Should have number the picture to know which one comes first
- It is not clear how much pressure should I put in the exercise "
"The exercise is very simple and can be done in most settings. It would not be unusual to do this exercise in an office setting.
It was a relaxing exercise and was effective in moving around my neck area.
I think that the drawings were clear but a video of the exercise might prove more effective. I think some verbal instructions may help but a video would be best. I agree with Sam that additional exercises like this would be helpful. It is tiring to sit at a desk all day so more stretches / exercises for the back, arms, legs, etc. would be beneficial. "
"the exercise encourages you to try it
the picture shows the simplicity of the exercise
however the picture fails to show how many times to do the exercise and for how long 
"
"The exercise is great for someone like myself who often has neck pain and needs to stretch out. This exercise was something that I had subconsciously done before to make my neck feel better. I thought that the directions definitely could have been clearer, but ultimately I was familiar with the idea of it. I was engaged with the exercise and felt better after doing it. It was not very innovative as I had done variations myself without calling it an exercise. One thing I would suggest is a video with verbal instructions because that is something that I often find helpful when learning something new relating to exercise."
"This exercise is relaxing
The picture of the exercise helped make it very self explanatory
I found the picture to be very clear
It was not clear how long or fast you should do the exercise
The exercise itself was very simple
I would do this exercise again if my neck was bothering me of if I was stressed out
I would recommend this exercise to a friend"
"my review for the neck exercise:
- it was relaxing
-it was unclear if it should be a continuous exercise or there should be breaks in between the steps
-i felt the tension in my neck and upper back diffuse
-The drawings were helpful
-It was unclear if I should be sitting or standing 
-I felt less stress once completing the exercise
-It was unclear how many times I was supposed to do the exercise
-I would do this exercise again and recommend to friends "
"The exercise was fine, though I think I strained my neck a bit too much during one of the movements.  The images were in clear in conveying what to do, but perhaps they could benefit from some written instructions to accompany them."
"I already knew about the exercise and how to do it; however, I imagine that those who have never tried out the exercise might find the directions and pictures confusing as they are very simplistic. I think that it would be beneficial to have descriptions under each of the pictures to explain what the person is doing and how to effectively mimic the exercise. The exercise does force the participant to become engaged and test out the activity which enables a person to be involved rather than observant. I agree that additional drawings should be included to help with the simplicity of the exercise. Further directions are definitely necessary because otherwise a person may fail to follow the exercise correctly and injure himself or herself or perform the exercise in a way that does not help the muscles in the neck. The picture should also describe what muscles the exercise is working when a person performs the activity. "
The neck exercise was useful. It is very brief. You also can enjoy stretching. The drawings were clear enough for those who were remotely familiar with them.
"The exercise is easy to understand
- in terms of time, It takes only a minute
- There is no direction as to how long It should be performed
- The drawings are very simple
- There is no direction on how much force should be applied"
"The following is my review of the exercise:
-The exercise is effective as it helps you relax.
-The quality of the images is good but they should be organized in a sequential manner.
-From an instruction perspective, there should be more visual aids that illustrate other details about the exercise for better guidance.
-The instructions should stress on other benefits of the exercise such as posture improvement to increase the probability of people doing such exercise again or even frequently. 
-The instructions should talk more about how often this exercise should be done."
"Exercise review:

This exercise Is quick and discreet and it can be done anywhere. This exercise allows you to relax through relieving stress from the neck. Some parts of the illustration was unclear and difficult to understand. Not much calories is being burned from this exercise and it is not very challenging.  "
"-The exercise is simple
-Nearly everyone does this without titling it ""an exercise""
-Relaxing technique that helps more when accompanied by deep breaths
-Picture is simple, although has slightly too much detail as the 4 pictures make it seems as though th"
"The exercise is very engaging, yet I found it to be relaxing in the end. The picture seemed self-explanatory, and the directions guided me in which direction to roll my head. Since this was a neck exercise, I did not expect to see any drawings or other body parts. It is a little unclear on the speed of the movement, because I know that going too fast would not be ideal for the neck. I think I did fine on this exercise and do not need further guidance on how to complete it."
"The exercise felt good, which encouraged me to repeat it. 
I found the drawings to be very clear, but I agree that there should be some written information. It could say why this exercise is effective, how much pressure you should give to the movement, and how you should feel afterward. For example, my neck cracked and I wasn't sure whether that was okay or not, so additional information would have been helpful.

"
"The exercise is easy to follow.
The drawings are a better alternative to text-only.
It did not take much time to memorize the steps.
My neck got relaxed after the exercise.
Maybe identify the gender with correspondent pressure would be better.
The drawings could be more attractive if were in color.
The exercise is worth recommending to especially those people who have little time for gym workouts.
The neck exercise is a good way to start a whole body warm up.
"
"The exercise is really help me relax my neck 
I have neck problem since 19, and it is really hurt when it pain. I believe using this exercise can help me release the pain
the exercise is easy to learn 
it is not clear how long I should do the exercise 
it can be make an video "
"The exercise is relaxing and stimulates you to do It again.
-i feel like The exercise would be More effective if It had written a description.
-i would recommend The exercise to someone that is under a lot of stress.
-The drawings are not as clear, but you can do The exercise by common sense.
-doing This by common sense might not be ideal since you can get hurt by doing It wrong."
"Here is my review for the neck exercise: 
- I found it very relaxing after a long day sitting at various desks.
- It helped to identify some neck stiffness that I did not know that I had. 
- I found the diagram helpful, but I would have liked to have some direction as to how long to do the exercise and hold each position (down, to the right, back, to the left).
- I have performed this exercise before and have experienced similar results.
- This exercise is also beneficial after working out.
- I would have liked to see a list of the benefits of performing this exercise.
- I am curious whether one's posture during the exercise affects its overall effectiveness.
- I appreciated that this exercise was restorative and not too rigorous.

"the excercise was relaxing
it was also easy to do

"* The exercise is a great way to prevent stiffness of the neck when working long hours in front of a computer. 
* The drawings are easy to understand however it is unclear for how long the exercises must be done. 
* The exercises are a way to relax/take a break from whatever one is doing.
* This is a great exercise as it does not require any additional equipment.
* The exercise is an extremely convenient way of staying focused while doing work (taking often breaks to do the exercise).
* The drawings of the exercise are very comprehensive and apprehensible.
The exercises are short and so it doesn't take too much time off someones busy schedule.
* The exercise doesn't require a high level of physical fitness which means almost everyone can do this exercise to improve their posture. 
* If someone does this exercise very often then it would naturally encourage them to fix their posture."
"This exercise was interesting. I was uncertain at first, but it loosened up my neck. I feel slightly less tense. The drawing was clear and easy to understand. The exercise is also something I can do while doing other things. I like that I don't have to go out of my way to do it. I can just do it while doing other things. 10/10 would do it again."
"The neck exercise was clear and simple.
It was relaxing and allowed me to destress. 
Verbal directions would be helpful to get us to make sure we were doing the right motions. 
More information on the benefits of this exercise should be listed to provide further clarity.
Other similar exercises should be listed."
"The exercise was basic and commonly known. Whilst there is not enough clarity on the direction of movement, the degree of stress needed to be applied as well as the extent to which one should stretch, these can be gauged from prior experience as it is an exercise known to many. The drawings could perhaps highlight the aforementioned missing details by printing it nearby to make it more effective. "
"This exercise is:
- Very relaxing
- Very useful in order to stretch my neck
- I would do it again
- Essential after every exercise"
"The exercise was simple and easy to follow

The graphic displaying how to do the exercise was effective in showing how to properly conduct this exercise. Although it does not display any other exercises for other parts of the body.

This exercise does not display the intensity or magnitude in which someone should conduct this exercise. Hence, some worded instructions or verbal queues may be useful when conducting this exercise in the future."
"The exercise left my neck more relaxed than before and it was a simple one that did not require much effort. 
I also like the simple drawings that showed me what to do.
Some kind of description along with the drawing would be helpful.
I liked this exercise, would do again 10/10.
It helped me relax.
I felt better afterwards slightly."
"The exercise is easy to do. It is also a bit relaxing and enjoyable. The exercise is also good for the upper back. The drawing of the exercise is a bit vague though. The drawings miss out on a lot of important information. Good thing about the exercise is that it can be done almost anywhere and does not even need any additional equipment. Unlike many exercises, this one shows the effects soon. The exercise is also good for the head as it can relax the brain."
The picture displays a good example of the exercise in how to do the neck rolls. The survey does not display what the excerise says to do. 
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:
-I find the exercise is interesting and useful to everyone. The picture demonstrates the neck movement clearly and easy to understand. 
-However, more information is needed for professional prospective including how often does a person need to do the exercise. Also, the picture could show how much stress should put on each movement and how long does each movement take. "
"The exercise is very relaxing.
The exercise is effective and easy to follow from the drawing.
I would recommend the exercise to people with colar bone problems
You might get a bit dizzy after the exercise if you do it for too long.
"
The drawings for the exercise were helpful because they made it easy to understand what head motions were required.  It made sure you did it until the end.  Movement for the rest of the body would have been nice also.  I would have appreciated a more thorough description as to why this was a helpful activity to do.  This way I would have known what to focus on and whether to put more pressure on some points.  Also in the past I have heard that tilting your head all the way back is bad for you so maybe that could have been addressed.  I would have enjoyed activities for the rest of the body as well.  Also how many times one should do the activity.  
"The exercises were relaxing and engaging
-The drawings help One understand how to perform The exercises However some of them could have been More clear
-There should be a description along with The drawings to notify participants exactly of what to do so There is no confusion
-unclear about how many times needed to complete each exercise, how much pressure to put on The neck While doing so, and how One should expect to feel to know if someone is doing It correctly"
The exercice was very simple and easy to do. It was not particularly innovative as those are all movements I would do myself without being advised to do so. The drawing was clear enough. I honestly do not have enough on this opinion to write more than a couple of sentences.
"The shoulder exercise review
+ The exercise is very fun and interactive. It encourages you to finish It since It helps to relieve The pain on your shoulder. i see The results of pain relief right After The exercise.
+in terms of instruction quality, The pictures/drawing is very effective and useful for people. It demonstrates The upper body: The back, arms, shoulders and neck.However, The quality of drawing instruction needs to be improved. for example, some directions of movements are not clear. It takes times to read and understand The whole exercise instruction."
"Here is my review for the neck exercise:

The exercise helped my relax.
The exercise helped to relieve neck tension.
The drawings were clear.
Verbal directions would have been a plus.
Despite, the lack of vocals, the drawing was concise and was effective.
The exercise is tough to not finish."
"Drawing was effective and easy to read
Exercise itself was easy to do
Do not know the effectiveness of this exercise "
The exercise shown is one i often do on my own to help relieve the stress carrying a backpack puts on my neck. The exercise not only helps to relax my muscles but also my mind. Taking a small amount of time to put my body's health and peace of mind helps to take the edge off from stress. The exercise also gives me a renewed sense of initiative and energy.  
"The exercise was simple
- The images were easy to follow
- The exercise is common and most people have probably done It
- i enjoyed The example
- written instructions could be useful for someone who is unfamiliar with The exercise
- would be nice to get an explanation of what The exercise achieves
- The exercise made me feel relaxed
- perhaps a video demo would be useful too"
This exercise was easy for me because it is similar to movements I have done subconsciously to relieve neck tension so I knew how to do it. I think the photos could have a little more detail to help the participant understand the movements better. The exercise ended with results that I expected at the beginning which I was pleased with. It was a convenience exercise that I think the majority of people would be able to do. 
"1.The exercise is pretty simple which encourage people to do it repeatedly.
2.The drawing is pretty clear to show the movement of head but no indication of body movement is showed.
3.Like general exercise, breathing is very important while we are doing exercise. The picture doesn't demonstrate when we should exhale or inhale while we are doing every single movement.
4.The picture doesn't know indicate how many times should we do this exercise in one day because we know too much exercise would damage our body instead.
5.The exercises contains a slightly complex movement--moving our heads around. This drawing only indicates the direction of head movement but doesn't show how we can move our head around. In my opinion, the painter should separate this picture into several sub-pictures that show every single movement of head.

- Maybe include guidelines as to how many times or how long we should do This for"
"I find this exercise to be very effective in releasing the tension in my neck and my upper shoulders. I feel as though the images are somewhat clear. They clearly show the motion of the neck, but fail to clarify how much physical exertion the exercise should entail. As it is a neck exercise, users must be careful. Neck injuries are serious injuries that occur too frequently. To avoid injury, there should be a warning alongside the drawings. I have done this exercise before. As an athlete who works out often, I find it very effective. I think others would also enjoy this exercise. It is, however, a very simple exercise, so in order to pursue a healthy lifestyle, it should be accompanied by other exercises."
"This exercise was extremely relaxing
- Its a great warm up or tension releaser
- Illustration should have been better"
"The exercise is relaxing
The exercise helped me to relief my stress
It is not clear how many times should i do it
The exercise ""cracked"" my neck in a good way
The exercise is not complicated , very easy to do
The exercise should not be analyzed this much
Analyzing this exercise stressed me again"
"I found the exercise very engaging and attractive.
When I saw the picture of the exercise I realised I had done it before after doing exercise in order to stretch.
I would understand if people did not get the drawings and had problems while trying to do the exercise because some of it is a bit unclear.
In terms of exercise, I think it is a good stretching exercise but we should not forget about shoulders and arms, which also suffer pain from being in a computer for long hours.
The speed and the stress that should be put on each movement could be a bit more clear.
I am a sporty person  and I am aware of how important it is to stretch your body after doing exercise with small movements like these one.
The strength that should be put into the exercise is not very clear "
Video instruction will be helpful. This exercise relaxed my neck muscle very much. It doesn't state how I can benefit from this exercise. Felt more like stretching rather than exercising. It is engaging and very helpful for beginners.
"Very relaxing exercise, though I would classify it more as a neck stretch. 

The diagram was a little confusing, but I had done the stretch before which helped me in completing it. Written instruction would be helpful."
"Here is my review for Arm Exercise:
"
"I really enjoyed the exercise because it loosened up m muscles.
I would recommend this to a friend.
There should be a video on how to properly do the exercise."
"I have seen this exercise before.

It was recommended by a family member and I know it's useful.

The picture looks really simple but effective."
"Neck problems are fairly common among the human population because our heads are very heavy and can easily strain ones neck. This exercise helps to alleviate some of that pressure by rolling out the neck. The drawing although clear could work to be even more clear in terms of which movements go first and in what order. I believe it would also be helpful if you knew how many times to repeat this excercise or what the ideal feeling is when it is done correctly. 
I believe a video with directional commentary would be the best way to format the instruction for this exercise."
"The pictures are very clear, especially The direction of movement.
-The exercise is very easy and encourages me to do it.
-After doing The neck exercise, my neck felt much relaxing. i would like to recommend This exercise to others."
"The exercise is relaxing. It release my pressure on The neck. i always do This exercise if my neck is uncomfortable.
- However, The drawing is a bit unclear. It should add The time to each movement.
- It can also add description words beside each drawing.
- if The drawings become colorized or change to video, This exercise will become More effective."
The exercises seems to be a little weird. I am not sure what the exercise is exactly. Is it supposed to improve fitness or relieve stress? I was never one who look to read descriptions of exercises. 
"The exercise is relaxing and allows me to move my head and relax my shoulders. 
in terms of the picture, the diagrams were easy to understand and to follow. 
I usually don't remember to exercise my neck, sine it is one of the most forgotten parts when it comes to everyday exercise.
I forget how much stress I put on my neck and shoulders, and being able to stretch and relax was very helpful.  "
"The exercise is engaging and is very easy to do. As it can be done in a sitting position, it is one of the most convenient exercise to do while sitting. The drawing of the exercise was very basic and minimal, however a short description of the exercise would have helped more for a better understanding of the exercise. The exercise quite effective and can be done in small time. Simple exercises are my favorite as they can be easily be done and can be shared with other people as well. "
"The exercise is fairly effective. I personally already do neck stretches on a daily basis and this could potentially be added to my routine. The directions were very clear due to the simplistic drawing. Granted, I may have found it to be easily understood because I have done similar exercises in the past.   "
"I think the directions from the pictures were very clear to follow. It was an exercise with minimum effort to spend. The exercise itself was very relaxing, and it definitely helped myself. "
"The seemed to have a positive effect. The picture was a little misleading because it seemed to want me to lean my head back before i leaned it to the right which seemed unconventional. The instructions did not indicate how much time I should've stayed in either of the position. I wasn't sure if the exercise stained my neck or not, is it actually beneficial to allow your head to hang as depicted. There should definitely be some more verbal direction as part of the description. "
"The stretch felt in the neck is very relaxing. As someone who enjoys the engagement of muscles, the stretch was very useful. The picture quality is fine, I could read instructions about back and leg posture without having to look at an image. It is very important to breathe during the exercise, inhale while holding the neck to the side then exhale while you rotate your neck. The neck stretch is part of my daily routine after I wake up to loosen up the neck and have a less rigid body. "
"It was not clear if I should rotate my neck in both directions or only one way. I was sure if the directions went step by step in an order from left to right/ up to down, or if they were broken down images of the last image which told me to rotate my neck. A short 4 second video could have explained the same information with more clarity and less time. "
The exercise was relaxing and I was able to do it multiple times and feel good about it. It would help to know how many times is recommended in order to relax your neck in a safe and healthy manner.
The neck exercise I think would be very effective for someone who sits in at a desk for long hours and doesn't often move around a lot. This would mainly reduce the pain in entire body because neck it connect to the spinal cord and by exercise the body part that matters would reduce the exhaustion and creates flexibility throughout the body. 
"This exercise is something I was taught all the way back in my middle school. I had quite the familiarity with this exercise because I've done it many times before. I wouldn't consider it an exercise in the traditional sense though, it is mostly considered stretching for the neck that even people who have never done it before do. The drawing was simple to understand for the most part because I already knew what had to be done. Other than that there was none to minimal muscle exertion because rotating my neck is something that we do daily even though we are unaware of it."
"The pictures do not appear in a clear order which made it tricky to follow. When I think of exercise, the neck is not a body part I naturally think of. The drawings should have been accompanied by written directions. For example, I did not know which way to rotate my head. The exercise was not as engaging as I expected it to be. Due to the time at which I did the exercise (early morning), it was not as refreshing. There were no repetitions of the exercise which made it seem obsolete. I would not do this exercise again on my own time. "
"The exercise is not engaging and does not encourage you to do it to the end. In terms of picture qulaity, the simplistic drawing is not very effective. Even though the neck is considered to be a main part of the body, we have to remembe rthe rest of our body. Should have had more pictures of back in the exercise. Most parts of the drawings in the execise were unclear. It is not clear the stress level one should put on his head. the drawings should have verbal directions."
This course is extremely engaging and it encourages you to do it to the end in terms of picture quality and drawing is really effective./ I really liked this course becuase i really le4arnt a lot regarding to it of myelf 
I think this exercise is not useful. It did not make me feel any better or worse. I believe that my neck is in perfectly fine condition. I do not believe that I need to rotate my neck in any way. I do not plan on doing this exercise again. The drawings were quite clear on what was needed to be done.
"The exercise was pretty straightforward. I have seen diagrams of this exercise before so its nothing new. The exercise wasn't too complicated because it only involved the neck and head. This seems like a good relaxing exercise to do when you've been sitting in the same position for a long time. I often see my parents or relatives do this exercise. It looks like its for old people to be honest. Nevertheless, it's still a pretty useful exercise for all ages to do. "
"The exercise felt like more of a stretch than an exercise. My neck cracked during the process. While i felt that the exercise made my neck looser, I don't feel that it made my neck stronger. This is how i normally think of the purpose of an exercise. I did feel more relaxed after doing the exercise. This is a movement i would do before exercising to stretch out. I feel that it is useful for relaxing and preventing stress. "
"The exercise is somewhat engaging. There isn't much movement, however, its still makes the reader do the exercise. Its is a very simply exercise that is relaxing. The drawings that demonstrate the motion of the exercise are clear and simple. Although it was a bit unclear on how much stress one should put on the directions of the movements. I believe that it is good and simple enough that verbal directions are unnecessary . "
"The drawing was effective in understanding what to to do in terms of easiness. Therefore, similar pictures for the back, shoulders and legs would be helpful in learning new exercises that can be used, making them easy to replicate. However, there should also be some verbal directions to follow for more complex exercises, which go into more detail about the amount of stress to put on each part of the exercise and how long it should last for.  "
"The directions were clear and easy to follow. 
The exercise was relaxing and felt good. 
The ambiguity of the stress to put on the neck was good, because it allows each person to stretch their neck to the extent that they think is best. 
Verbal directions may help but are not necessary. 
I enjoyed the exercise and I will likely continue using it after this. "
"The exercise shown in the diagram appears somewhat unclear just based on the order of movements. That being said, I interpreted it based on past attempts of doing a very similar neck exercise. It may sometimes feel uncomfortable, but it is very helpful in dealing with neck discomfort. There should be some writing instructions to the diagram in order to better convey what posture should be taken, the rate at which one should do the movements and how long the stretches of the exercises should be. "
"I like how the exercise lets you take a minute to relax and move your head around, taking also some pressure off your shoulders. For it to be more effective, it would need to include other body parts(i.e. back,)."
The picture of the exercise is clear and it can help to relax my neck.
"I do this exercise quite often when I wake up or I am sitting for long periods of time.

"
"The pictures could be a little more detailed.
There could be maybe some color added to the pictures. 
Maybe add some numbers to the pictures to show the next step.
Maybe have a girl version and not just a guy one. 
The exercises is not that engaging enough for me to continue to the end. 
Add some better exercises. 
i do not know how much strength I should put in to the exercise. 
Add a scale for strength to exert. "
"After I answered that first question, I was told that I have a poor understanding of exercise. That put me in a pretty bad mood, because I don't think that's true. So I am not really motivated or confident in my ability to do the neck thing. Also, tilting my head in weird directions usually make my neck crack so I didn't want to participate in this activity. The drawing was good and made sense for me so had I chosen to seriously try out the physical aspect of this, that would have been great."
"The exercise is a very familiar exercise to me. I do this exercise either before or after my work outs. When I did Latin Ballroom dancing, I would always stretch my neck before I started to dance. It would make me feel less stiff. I also do this exercise after finishing any high intensity work out. It relives my body of any stress that I might have put on it during the work out. I really like this exercise and any other exercises that involve stretching your neck. "
The exercise was very lame and I did not get anything out of it. It all seems like trick questions. I am annoyed taking this study. I feel like nothing useful is being gained from anyones participatiion in this study. 
"The exercise is engaging and relaxing. It is not a great exercise on its own, but it is a useful stretch for many workouts. I have done this exercise often and found it very useful. The drawing of the exercise could have possibly been more clear about the order and transition of the steps. This stretch could be potentially dangerous if a person has not warmed up beforehand, because the diagram does not give clear directions on how far to stretch one's head. The exercise overall is a good and useful exercise."
"I usually go to Pilates or a barre class. I have scoliosis therefore, I need to do exercises that help me with that. Sometimes I get back pain and these exercises help me avoid that. I also enjoy going spinning.  "
"The exercise is really relaxing and helps to relieve tension in the neck area, especially after sitting at the desk for long periods of time. It is unclear whether or not the person should be standing or sitting or how fast the movement should be. The drawing is effective because it shows the general movement of the exercise, however, it could definitely be more specific. The exercise is simple to understand. I enjoy this exercise and will remember to do it once every few hours. My neck felt better after doing this exercise."
"The drawings depicting how the exercise should be done were well drawn and informative. I had no trouble replicating these movements and felt reassured that I was doing it correctly. I think that more drawings like this for other body parts other than the neck would be just as effective. However, more complex movements would benefit from either verbal directions or more detailed information, such as degree of strength."
This exercise was clear with what to do by the picture that was shown.  however I am not sure how much it helped me feel relaxed or helped me in general.  I do not think I would recomend this exercise to a friend becuase it did not seem very useful.  I do not really understand the point of that exercise.  
This exercise was fairly boring. I'm not sure how useful it would be to my life. I'm also kind of insulted that your program said I do not have a good grasp on what exercise is because I work out 5 times a week so I'm done answering your questions now.
"the exercise is boring and I consider that is not that useful
if I want to do exercise I would rather go play tennis, soccer, run or any other sport
the drawings were good and easy to understand
i did this exercise many times and I do not consider it that usefu"
The exercise is relaxing and feels fairly good. I am concerned cracking my neck may have negative effects. The diagram gave good instruction on how to do the exercise. 
"Personally, I enjoy the exercise because I have some issues with pain in my neck. It was a relatively simple exercise that can be followed through the picture instructions. Certain details like how much pressure or how long to do each section could have been clarified. This is a good exercise that can be completed without any equipment and doesn't require much space. I think it's good for people who may work long hours at a computer of office job and it's easier enough to complete. "
"I don't think that this should be classed as an exercise, but more like a stretch. I see an exercise as more rigourous than just turning your neck, however it still has its uses and practicality. The movement wasn't exactly relaxing but it wasn't uncomfortable either, therefore perhaps my form was just poor. As I don't typically sit behind a computer or on a desk all day, perhaps the movement wasn't tailored for me. I don't get very stressed or feel back pain, however I can understand why this movement would be helpful. "
The figures were simple to follow. I don't know how ground breaking or necessary the drawings are because I know little to nothing about exercise and I do this exact one on a regular basis just out of instinct. The picture was effective in directing me how to move my neck. Additional drawings that might be helpful and not well known or obvious could be useful. It also doesn't say how often one should do this exercise. It doesn't say what to do to avoid the pain or discomfort. It could list of ways to sit so that the exercise is more effective.  
The exercise helped loosen my neck. The picture given as instructions were clear and I knew what to do. I've done an exercise like this or similar to this before. It can be helpful when your neck is stiff after sitting at the computer for too long. It does not specify the speed of how fast someone should be turning their neck. It also doesn't tell you how hard you should be doing the exercise. The instructions does not specify how many times someone should be doing it. 
"The exercise is very effective on reducing stress and tension within the neck and back areas. Also, the diagram was very easy to follow and there was no confusion regarding how to preform this exercise. There could be a bias though, because I assume most people are familiar with relaxing their necks. I do agree there isn't a clear indication about how much stress should be put on each movement. That being said, i do really think it's up to the individual due to our own comfort, and how our ability to judge how much tension is right. There is kind of one swift movement so its not hard to comprehend, and shouldn't need verbal directions. This is a especially a good exercise for older individuals at desk jobs who forget to use their muscles often and need to release tension."
"First off, the presentation of the exercise could be better. My suggestion would be to use verbal directions to supplement the pictures. The directions should also be clear as to how the exercise should be conducted - i.e. angle and tilt of neck, as well as stress. There should also be a brief explanation elaborating on the pros of the exercise; for example, what muscles it engages and benefits. Secondly, the exercise isn't very useful in my opinion. It does have potential of alleviating neck pain and relaxing the muscles. When you're sitting at a computer for several hours, however, the pain is not so much located in the neck as it is in the back muscles and shoulders. There should be exercises for these two primary muscle groups. This current neck exercise should be included along with other helpful ones - those dealing with the back and shoulders. "
Overall the exercises were clear to understand and I knew how to perform them. They were not difficult to perform
"I used to do this exercise myself. It was first recommended by my mother, and I find it helpful and engaging. Some of my close friends suffers from neck-problems at a very young age. In order to prevent this kind of health issues, I am willing to practice it quite offenly. "
The exercise was very easy to do and I am very familiar with it to begin with. I do it all the time to stretch my neck and loosen up. I do it maybe 3-4 times a day.
Yeah I don't understand the exercise at all. The instructions were not clear. I don't think I even saw instructions. I definitely did not read any instructions. I like to skip through these exercises as fast as possible. I am thinking about hopefully playing some pond hockey or tennis later today. 
not a fun one.
"This exercise helped me being relaxed and comfortable. Since people nowadays tend to work in front of desk, looking at cell phone, and etc they need to do some exercise related to the neck. This exercise will enhance the ability to soothed the pain and more durable during the work. However, not only neck but other parts of the body are important as well such as shoulders, back, and etc. Therefore, people should exercise on other parts of the body rather than just doing neck exercise. "
"It's important for students to relax after studying for a long time sitting in front of a table or a computer. The exercise is easy to follow and doesn't take many spaces to do, so I will do it during the class breaks. I will also recommend it to my friends."
"Exercise is something you do when you are bored and or have nothing else to do. It is usually accompanied with eating a huge meal such as the one after thanksgiving when you gain a tremendous amount of weight. Now, basic exercise tips include, stretching before workout.  "
"I thought it was pretty clear what the exercise was asking me to do. I do do this neck exercise pretty often when stretching, so that might influence why I thought the diagram was easily understandable. It might be better if the drawings were placed in a specific order to help though. "
"I think this exercise is ok. Although I can't understand the purpose of it, I think doing some excersices is fun and is healthy to our body."
"The exercise was not original. The diagrams were good for prompting these basic movements. I would of course do these exercises again because they are universal, easy and rewarding. If there were more detailed exercises or perhaps stats on how effective these stretches are that would be more useful. I wouldn't recommend these exercises because everyone already knows them. "
The exercise is very relaxing and it was kind of boring. It is not clear whether one should put stress on the neck or if we had to do it gently. The drawings should be accompanied by instructions so that it can be more specific.
"The picture wasn't very good, in my opinion. I wasn't sure what exactly to do. The drawing should be accpomanied by some text to further explain. "
"In terms of picture quality, the simplistic drawing is very effective. Even though the neck is considered to be one of the main body parts influenced by one's postures, we still need to remember about the back, the shoulders and the legs too. So additional drawings like that for the back would be great. Some part of the drawings in the exercise were a bit unclear, for example the direction of the movement. The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. It is not clears how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go to tilting one's head. 
"
"This exercise in helpful to release some pressure or tiredness. However, it best works when it's unintentional and you do it whenever you feel like doing it. "
I don't even consider this an exercise. This is a normal body movement that you should do every day when you wake up. Nothing different from stretching your ankles or arms and back when you wake up. It literally takes 10 seconds to do it. But I love doing it. I love stretching my neck. I even like to crack it sometimes. It feels so great. Sometimes I forgot that I didn't stretch it in the mornings and in the middle of class I'll just do it and feel the crack and it's like an euphoria. It's truly great. 
This exercise is bad for u 
"It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go tilting one's head. The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. Also, the purpose of the exercise is unknown, as so are the benefits."
"The exercise was simplistic and able to be done wherever

It was not very effective and resulted in a less tense neck

Felt more like a stretch than a workout"
Excersise is pretty boring and I really don't care for excercising at all. Ilike to be active by playing sports and that is how I excercise so I am not a huge fan of any especially that silly neck rolling one.
"The diagram was kind of confusing
there should have been words accompanying the images
the excersize was relaxing
I have done this exercise before in yoga and sports
it is good for relieving stress
"
"The drawings were simple and easy to follow. While I did not feel completely comfortable while doing the exercise, it was easy to do. You do not need any special equipment or space to do the exercise. You can simply do it at your desk or wherever you are. While sitting for this study, I did feel my neck tensing up and getting uncomfortable, so it was useful to use this exercise. It is probably useful for people who work at desks and use computers for long periods of time. However, the exercise was not very fun or innovative, and I did not feel fully engaged in it. Instead, I just felt like I was stretching my neck."
I think the fact that we had to watch and interesting video and pay attention to what it was actually about made me be more engage in the study.
"This is a very simple exercise that every person who works out do for stretching. 
I don't understand the need to evaluate this exercise.
It does make me feel good but that's about it.
Nothing exotic, nothing special about this exercise. "
"This exercise is confusing because there are many parts and I wonder how they are all connected. It does not really encourage me to do it to the end, but that is only because I am here in order to get credit for a class (sorry). However, I understand the value and necessity that goes into these studies and the hard work it takes. I respect that, too. At first I was engaged in this survey but then it took longer than expected (although I did commit to a full hour, so I don't know why I am surprised). I feel sick because I ate the entire M&Ms because I have no self-control. They were yummy and I like chocolate (especially near period time...but I'm not about to get my period lol). Directions were clear on this study. I don't know why I bet on the mug (I wouldn't purchase them anyway because I don't really have school spirit - in addition, not a lot of people at BU really has school spirit as they always wear spirit gear from other schools). There is no need for improvement, maybe a bit of clarification as to why or how all these parts are inter-connected (unless you need us to be blind or double-blind etc. to this study)."
"This is a very common exercise that most athletes do at the start of a warm-up. The older you are, the more thought you tend to put into it, as you may have spent more time at a computer. The diagrams were clear, but I didn't really feel like following along by myself in front of a computer. It's a good exercise to start out with, as it requires very little movement. Come to think of it, people often perform this exercise without thinking about stretching at all. I've seen a lot of people do it in class or at work just to wake themselves up a bit. The exercise does not need to be more effective. The question before the exercise should be a bit more specific, as the questions regarding what the subject is unsure about are off-putting. No one thinks about innovation when they exercise. Unless they are in physical therapy, maybe. Who's to say? "
"This exercise is useless and meaningless. of you really want to exercise you should probably go to the gym after a long period of time sitting in front of your computer. Also, some parts of the drawing is unclear and I can hardly get the meaning and rhe direction of the activity. "
This exercise is quite engaging and easy to follow. I would highly recommend this activity to my friends. I think this exercise will be helpful with my neck. College students should have some more exercises like this. We need to spend less time on our computer. Health is a big problem that needs a lot of attention. The drawings are pretty good. The movements make my neck feel comfortable. 
"I thought that the diagram provided a very clear idea on the directions. However, I am still confused as to this part of the survey in general. I thought that the directions and wording could be a lot clearer. I feel that the neck is definitely one major part of the body, but it would be great to include the shoulders and back as well, since most of the time it's mostly those body parts that cause inconvenience when I'm in front of a screen too long."
"This exercise was relaxing and enjoyable. It helped my neck to become less rigid and more flexible. I've been bending my neck a lot today by typing on my computer, looking on my phone, and other things. This exercise helped to stretch the muscles and loosen them up from becoming so tense. The diagram shown before was very simple and easy to understand. So, I could do the exercise without trying to figure out where my neck should roll and such. "
This is a review on the exercise. The exercise instructions seemed fairly clear and fairly simple. I remain impartial to is. I found there to be really no benefit to the exercise. But also there are no downsides to it. would I do it again? probably not. If my neck is feeling stiff I have my own exercises. That Is my review. hope you enjoy.
"In terms of drawing, I like the simplicity of it. It efficiently clarifies what should I do."
"The drawing of the neck exercise was very clear. The step by step diagram of the exercise was helpful. A recommendation would be to outline the steps of the exercise. The picture does not say how fast you should move through the movement. Verbal direction may have been helpful for someone who has never done the exercise before. I feel biased because I have done the exercise before. Instead of a drawing, pictures of someone demonstrating the exercise may have been more useful. It would have made it more engaging."
"The exercise is something I do all the time. I have severe back and neck pain so I tend to do this exercise a lot. I feel as though the picture displayed the movements of the exercise well. My biggest recommendation is to may explain how fast someone should do the exercise. If someone does the neck motion too fast or too slow, it may cause more damage than good. Since I know this exercise well, I was able to do it at a correct pace. "
"I guess it would be helpful to include a verbal element or video to explain the exercise. I don't really think this is a big deal. It would be helpful to include information on whether or not the exercise is good for you and why. Again, not sure why this is a big deal. The drawing is pretty clear. I guess in terms of holistic exercising (I don't know what you are going for or what your purpose is) it would be beneficial for an exercise regime to have more than just a neck exercise."
I personally was not the biggest fan of the exercise. It made my neck feel uncomfortable and put too much pressure on my neck. It also made me a bit dizzy and I felt uncomfortable doing it. I prefer to simply crack my neck when I want to stretch it. This exercise may work for other people I was just not a fan.
The exercise was very helpful. It targets the neck where people have a lot of built up tension. Following the pictures on how to  move the neck help to relieve any tension. In my opinion other body parts are just as important to stretch out. I think if they gave us more stretches to do it will benefit the person doing them. I think the directions were simple enough that anyone can do them without having to exert a lot of energy. 
"Overall, the exercise was really useful and comfortable. College students normally sit in front of computer or desk for long time everyday, and this easy exercise can ease their sour, pain, and decrease stress. It is engaging and encourages me to do to it again. However, one thing I would like to recommend is that the drawings can be accomplished by some verbal directions to make it easier to be understood. "
"Although the drawing is not clear about how far one should tilt their head, it is implied that the person should do as much as they are comfortable with. Although this does not engage multiple parts of the body, it is a good quick exercise to release some tension. This should not be the only exercise a person should be doing, else that will lead to more health impediments. "
"The exercise was very engaging showing step by step with pictures made it easy to follow. In addition, it allowed for you to focus on the tension in your neck instead of other body parts. I believe a short little video would have been better for the pictures though to make the viewer more confident. "
"I liked the exercise because it was short and engaging. I also had some pain in my neck so it felt good to stretch it out. It was very clear based off the pictures shown what i had to do. I don't think i would have needed any additional drawings to understand how to complete the exercise. One thing though was the order in which to do the exercise, i wasn't sure with which one to start. "
"The exercise really does engage you, when you follow through with it to the end. Though the picture was quite difficult to understand of what order and how to do it right. I feel like a video of seeing someone else do it would have been better. Though I can definitely see why someone would do this as it would be able to stress relieve. I'm certain that my friends would also like this exercise considering that they also sit weirdly in front of their computers.Also the pictures could not tell us about how intense we should be tilting our heads and that would be good to know. Just in case we hurt ourselves."
"The drawings of the exercises really helped understand what I was supposed to do when performing them. They felt really relaxing and helped me relieve some of my neck tension. The drawings didn't have much explanation however, I don't find the exercises to be very difficult so I think the amount of description was just right. However, when I feel tense as a result of being sitting on the computer all day, my back tends to hurt as well. The emphasis of these exercises was the neck, not any other part of the body. I believe adding exercises for the back would help me relieve more stress. "
"It is unclear which direction one should move in the exercise. Although there are pictures, I think that the diagram should contain words as well. I enjoyed the exercise. It actually stretched out the parts in the neck that had tension. The exercise isn't engaging and it starts to all feel the same when you move in different directions. It is unclear how long you should do it for in order to fully execute the exercise. The drawings would be great for other exercises as well especially for people who have trouble reading and following directions."
"the exercise was not bad. should be more specific about the steps. also in order to let people it is truly effective, it should explain more about the scientific reasons behind it. also, the drawing should be more clear. it should have more instructions on the side so that people would know how to do it correctly. "
"The exercises were not completely clear given the picture. It would have been better if accompanied by words or a video. It was engaging when I figured out how to do it, but that took too long. I'm not sure how this will lower stress. If I am stressed, I will usually stand up. If I feel fatigued at my desk, it is usually due to back pain which this didn't help. I would choose a different exercise. I think this could be improved."
"The drawing was simple and easy to read, but did not instruct details like direction, how far to turn, and how much stress to put into the movements. Also, the drawings were not numbered so it takes a moment to figure out the right order of movements. The drawings make the exercise seem boring and not engaging, and the lack of detail leaves the exercise completed without feeling satisfyingly stretched or relaxed. It is unclear which movement to start with and which to end with, and how to reset your posture when you've finished. Even though the neck is influenced by posture, it is not the only part hurt by sitting often, so additional notes or drawings about the back and shoulders would make the exercise more fulfilling. While this exercise helps temporarily ease the stress of sitting in the neck, an exercise or notes on how to sit better, how often to do the exercise, and other details would give the exercise a lasting effect. The drawings should include labels or notes with written directions to make the exercise clearer to understand and easier to follow."
"To do the exercise, It's really important to do it to the end. The pictures of exercise may not be clear enough to show the detail of the exercise, such as the direction of movement. Also it might confuse about how much stress should you do for each steps, therefore you might do the exercise uncomfortable. Especially when the movements are complex, it's hard to tell the detail. So the exercise drawing should come with a clear and short phrase that describe the movements. Pictures and words are the best way to describe a thing. "
"What i liked most about the exercise is how simple it is. It is honestly possible to do the exercise anywhere. It engages you in a way that focuses on each side of the neck. I do think that there  should have been word or arrows accompanying a few of the pictures because some of the exercises were a bit unclear. It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go tilting one's head. However, The picture was to unclear because i did perform the exercises."
"The exercise was useful  after a log time of study or work. But is is hard to know how many times of this exercise should be conducted. It would be a lot better if there was clear instruction in words to help the users to better follow the details of the exercise to achieve a better results. It can be improved by how many times should be used after a certain period of study. Also, it would add some bad outcomes that might have if the neck stay still for a long time to increase the awareness of the health of neck. It can labeled the pictures as well. If there would be same type of exercise, it will be good as well."
"The exercise is not as engaging as it could be. There is no use for doing that even I feel relaxing a little after doing so. However, there has no huge impact towards to my health or life. I don't like the picture demonstration at all because it doesn't provide concise information including how much should I turn my neck to. I think it will be better if it was demonstrated by video with verbal explanation. I feel more stressed after doing the exercise because my neck hurts while doing it. I wander what was wrong with my neck."
The drawings were 2d it would be more helpful if there was a video instead. The directions of the movements were not clear. This exercise is hard to apply if some one has an injury. 
"I'm not really sure if this is more of an exercise or a stretch, but it felt relaxing. This is something I do with my neck throughout a day anyway, so I was used to it. I thought the instructions and drawings were clear as it was a very basic task. Maybe the only thing they could do is say how long to hold everything."
The exercise was clearly portrayed by the images and I was already familiar with the exercise prior to this research study.  It would be a good idea to incorporate other exercises targeted other muscles effected by sitting down for long periods of time like your back and shoulders.
This exercise is engaging but very basic. The pictures do provide a good indication of what you have to do and how to preform the exercises correctly. It is not clear how much stress one should put on each movement and how far one should go tilting one's head. Some more detailed instructions would have made for a more engaging experience and one where the subject would know to a greater extent what he should be doing.
"The exercise definitely was relaxing, but I do not know about how useful it is towards my body.
It was unclear how to do certain parts of the exercise and how much for how long we needed to do it.
To me, it seemed more like a normal reaction a person would have trying to stretch out their necks After staying in the same position for too long.
"
"The drawings were simple but clear. I liked that there was no direct order to follow to do the exercise. I've done this exercise before, so I am comfortable with it. I think from the pictures that the exercise should not be done forcefully. The drawings depict a smooth, easy exercise to do. Because it is the neck, I think it is okay to do this one exercise alone while busy. I think this exercise should be followed by back exercises from the above comments. Since they are in the same area, I believe back and neck exercises would go well together."
The exercise is not engaging. In terms of picture quality the simplistic drawing is very effective.Additional drawings should be made for the back and legs too. The drawings were simple to follow.
This was just an exercise tom relax your neck. How the hell am I suppose to write a paragraph about it?
"The exercise is easy to understand and easy to do. There is no instruction but only drawing.  The drawing is clear and detailed. If more parts are involved, that will be good. Results can be better. There should be step numbers on the side. Overall a good exercise."
"The exercise was engaging and made me stretch out my neck. It was unclear however as to how far you should stretch your neck. It was also unclear as to which way you should move your neck (ie clockwise, counterclockwise). The true purpose of the exercise was also unclear. I was not certain that the exercise helped me with my posture. The exercise should have had written instructions to clarify and misunderstandings. If the true purpose of the exercise is to help posture, then there should have been other exercises that dealt with other body parts. For instance, my back usually hurts more than my neck when sitting at a desk for a long time, so I think a back exercise would have been more helpful. "
"From my own perspective, I used to do this neck exercise a lot, because I usually have a shoulder and neck pain. I am familiar with the procedures and steps, and the drawings illustrated are clear enough for me to understand the entire process. However, for those who have never seen this neck exercise before, the drawings are supposed to be accompanied by some verbal instructions to clarify. More importantly, it should mention the warnings and the potential risks of doing this exercise, as it might hurt your muscle or joints unexpectedly, if you do this exercise in a wrong way."
"The exercise is relaxing, and I feel much more comfortable after doing so. 
The picture instructions are useful and easy to be understood.
I think the drawer can add more detailed instructions.
It's important to know more about this exercise because neck is one of the most important part of the body.
However, I don't know how many times I should do in one day. 
Additionally, I'm not clear about if there is a hurt after doing so many times.
And it doesn't mention the name of the exercise which means that we can not search online.
Overall, it is an exercise which is easy to do.
"
I think that the exercise is simple and easy to do so that it entices the person to do it. The photos show a good step by step to make it clear to the person to do it. Only issues are that you  don't know how far you should have or tilt your head or how much pressure you should put on each movement. I think that it is effective 
i dont like the exercise. they are boring and time consuming. i want to go home
"The drawing for the exercise was clear, i felt like the exercise was relaxing and easy to do. There was not much physical activity to be done, however it provided a decent stretch. There really is no need for the drawing to have verbal directions to make it more effective. "
"The exercise shown was very clear. It was easy to follow along and complete. I thought it was relaxing. However, I did not feel that it was very effective. I think exercises for other parts of the body would be more effective. For example, my back often aches from sitting with the same posture for so long. I liked the exercise as a whole, but probably would not recommend to someone else."
"The exercise was very simple to carry out. It gave simple picture instructions on how to proceed. It didn't feel engaging, especially not socially. Also, it didn't give any reason as to why we should carry out this exercise or how it can be beneficial to us. I believe such exercise should also be done in groups of people and not individually because it offers an opportunity to socialize and talk to other people about the right performance of this exercise."
"This exercise is useful. We can do it anytime during the breaks. It is easy to remember. However, a lot of people already knew it, including me."
"The exercise is engaging.
I would like to do it in order to relax my pressure when I am tired of studying.
I will recommend my friends to do this while they feel stressful.
The picture is simple and easy to understand. 
I would like to see more drawings about other parts of the body.
However, the drawings can include more detailed information such as how much stress one should put on each movement.
Also, I think videos will be more engaged and more clear.
Overall, it is a good exercise.
"
"The picture was easy to understand, but I would have liked to see some exercises for the back posture as well. I believe that the back carries the main load when sitting, and by having some proper drawings of exercises for the back the total exercise would become better. 
The exercise is very simple to do and engaging to a certain level. However, Is this really an exercise for the neck or more of a stretch?
It is not clear how rough one is supposed to be. It is very easy to overdo it and then do it too hard. A chiropractor friend of mine suggested that one should be careful when doing such exercises with the neck and back because of potential strains one could get.
I do believe that the drawings could come with some more relevant information. How far, how fast, and what to do first should be written down so that people understand it easier."
I think the exercise is very effective. It releases tension that builds up in your neck and shoulders. It would be a good exercise to do before class or after class. I think the drawings were clear and people know to do the exercise at their own pace and capabilities.
"This exercise was mediocre because I do no believe it is very engaging and useful in my opinion. Overall, I believe there are better ways to pursue exercise and not just do simple neck stretches. Going to the gym and doing full stretching/warming up routines will be much more useful and effective as opposed to a ten second activity performed at an office desk. Yes, this exercise will relieve some tension from the neck area most likely, however, I do not believe it is a solution to solving posture and neck pain problems. Overall, the drawing was useful in demonstrating the activity, and verbal directions would most likely have made it better. Also, it was not clear how much tension I should put on the twisting actions on my neck, that was the only confusion with the drawing."
"The exercise helps when you have a stiff neck for looking at the screen for a long time. I feel that it will be extremely helpful during long study sessions, especially around midterms and finals period. Although the direction of movement of the exercise is unclear, it seems as if any direction works. The drawing is simple and effective, so that anyone can learn the exercise quickly. The exercise is very engaging. It also encourages you to do to the very end. I feel that the drawings should be accompanied by verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. Overall, I think it is a quick and effective exercise to relief the stress of a stiff neck. "
"The exercise is very clear and easy to understand. I feel that there can be more of an effort made to address other parts of the body that are also effected. These parts include both the lower and upper parts of the back, as well as the shoulders. The drawings in the exercise were simple and understandable, clearly stating the desired direction of the neck movement and exactly how much of tilt should be applied. The exercise could be more effective however if some verbal directions accompanied the drawings to answer any potential questions one might have. Such a question could be how slow a full rotation of the neck should be and if the movement stays at constant pace throughout the whole exercise. Besides that, the overall directions of the exercise are helpful with communicating to the participant effectively."
"The picture of the exercise was pretty clear, but could have been a bit better with more use of directional arrows. The exercise was somewhat effective, but does not really do that much for your neck."
The drawings and simple pictures gave a clear presentation of how the exercise is to be performed. Some word descriptions may have been helpful.
"The exercise helped my neck feel better. I'm not entirely sure why this is important. Its not an exercise its a stretch. The drawings were pretty clear. Sitting at a computer can definitely strain your neck. Computer position is important. Neck pain can be serious. More than just the neck can hurt, however.  "
This exercise could be helpful after studying long hours. Other exercise could be useful other than this. This exercise is definitely the most important. The drawings were enough for instructions. The drawings made it clear for the exercise to be effective.
The exercise helped me relaxed. The exercise engaged muscles in my neck in shoulders. It is not clear how this exercise helped me. The exercise was well outlined by the pictures. If there was a certain amount of time we were supposed to do it for that would have been better. It was a pretty simple exercise. I did the exercise very quickly. I don't plan on doing it again.
"The drawings were very useful to know what to do in the exercises. Because the pictures were in order, it helped to see how to do them. The arrows also helped to know the direction in which to do the exercise. The exercise was helpful and did help to relieve stress in my neck. I do not think this exercise is particularly innovative because it is something that many people do without having drawings. I do not think the drawings were completely necessary to understand how to do the exercise. For more complicated exercises, words may be helpful to demonstrate the exercise. Overall the exercise was helpful, but did not address my concerns. "
"people often undermine the danger of injuring our neck. the neck is considered to be one of the body parts influenced by one's posture, so we need to do the same to the shoulders and legs too. however, the drawings were unclear because it doesn't stress the example of the direction of the movement and how much stress you should put on each of the movement. "
"The exercise is simple and easy to do. It may be so simple that it is ineffective. The exercise is engaging though. The drawings are very helpful. They are descriptive enough that you know exactly what to do. However, it is unclear how much pressure who should strain your neck. You don't want to pull a muscle in your neck. So it should be a bit more specific."
The exercise is a little unclear from the picture. Some words to go along with the picture would help out a lot. The exercise also is one that is a pretty normal one. I feel like people do this on their own anyway. It is unclear also how long someone should do the exercise for. A video on how to do the exercise would also be helpful. 
"In terms of instructions, it was a bit unclear as to what I was supposed to do. However, after self-implications, I exercised what was displayed in pictures. As I was doing the exercises, I felt very relaxed and it helped me feel at ease. I would definitely do these exercises in the future. Again, the only criticism I would have when participating this research study is the directions part and the order of sequence. The drawings should be accompanied by some verbal directions to make the exercise more effective. I am not quite sure how these exercises affected my mood, but for some reason it did. "
"The drawing is good enough for us to understand what is expected to be done, but it is very unclear on how helpful the exercise is if there is no description to go along with it. It also is not clear how much stress one should put in each movement, which can render the exercise pointless if the person does not do it right. Since there are no verbal directions one cannot be certain it is being helpful.
"
"I felt as though this exercise was great for stretching out my neck. I have dealt with chronic neck pain for years and am always looking for ways to help stretch my neck and alleviate pain. I liked the drawings, as they made the stretch very easy to understand and do without any fear that I would be doing them incorrectly. The one drawback that I did not see but some other students may is that there is no time specified for each portion of the stretch. I would hate to see someone whipping their head around thinking that they are stretching their neck when in reality they are just doing damage."
"The exercise was common, and did not seem very complex. The pictures depicting the exercise proved useful in portraying the way the exercise is to be performed; however, additional pictures revealing the structure and use of the exercise may be more beneficial in understanding the exercise. It would be nice to see what parts of the neck the exercise was affecting, as well as seeing additional exercises that help the body's posture. Altogether, the pictures were sufficient enough to demonstrate the exercise."
"-The exercise is simple and easy to perform. It doesn't require much, other than common sense and basic recognition of the simple drawing to understand what you need to do.

-It is unclear how many repetitions of this exercise would be optimal, given that"
"It's not clear how much the lower part of the body should move or stay the same. The drawings would be more helpful if they are in color and with full human body. To draw a connection, the human body of the drawing could be students. It's not clear how much people should move, like the angles. But all in all, this is a common exercise that many people know about and do. However, from a news or research that I've read quite some time ago, it said that this exercise does some hard to the neck. So it would be good if we are given more information about the pros and cons of the exercise. So we could make use of it effectively."
The exercise was relaxing and felt good. The picture describing how to do it was simple and easy to understand. It was not unclear. The drawings could have been accompanied by written instructions to make it more simply to understand. Additional exercises for other parts of the body would be nice too. The back and shoulders get sore easily too so exercises for those should be included as well. Instructions for more complicated exercises should be more in depth and informative. Certain parts of the body get more stressed out than others.
"its simple enough to do it
it worked, I cracked my neck
it felt good
the drawings clearly showed how to do the exercise
I didn't have any confusion about the drawings. 
its unclear how many times to  repeat this exercise
"
"The excersise was clear and consice, it is a similar excersie to something that i have done before plenty of times...so it is assumed how to do it properly. "
"I don't think this exercise is engaging, especially when I am told that sitting is bad while I  had to do this experiment while sat down.  
In stead of using pictures to demonstrate, why don't use a video clip? Video clip will not only show the movements, but also add some audio directions too. "
I think that the neck should be moved more often in that way. We dont realize how much we rely on it throughout the day and it seems like it would help a lot. 
"If you are lazy and don't want to get up from your seat and walk around the room, then this exercise is recommended for you. This is only for stiff necks and not for anything else.
The instructions were confusing because it did not tell you the duration of the exercise, the speed, the direction, and how many times you should do it. 
This is not a helpful exercise because I feel it is almost instinctual to do this type of movement. 
Like if it were more innovative and exciting then I would recommend this for other people. 
Imagine doing this in class. Your head might hit someone else's in the area. 
Provide clear information on wear one should perform this exercise. "
