"It is a very good cartoon. I like the voices. I like the drawings. It is what it is, a cartoon. It wasn't meant to change the world. Just watch it. Enjoy it. That is the purpose. It is cute. It is well thought out. I liked it. It was cool."
"The impact of the message is lost in the use of the wierd gobbledegook verbiage.  I think it's an admittedly creative, interpretive approach to a simple message (cars are more trouble than they're worth, our need for speed is dangerous, bad for the engvironment, can put you in opposition to the law, and empty your pocketbook by incurring expensive tickets - a slow bicycle is the better transportation bet) but it is just too complicated (sophisticated) for the average intelligence of the human being. But maybe they're smarter in Europe (the prime target audience for consumption of this production.) Simlify it...bring it down to earth, would be my critique."
Just a simpl cartoon based on old time gags. This cartoon does nothing for the newer generation. Grand pa and his family would have been delited back in the day watching this. Today how ever it is a bore. Was it in French? maybe. The thought of police blowing a whistle at you is laughable and the most amusing thing in this cartoon.
"Cartoons are likely a form of entertainment that your students are very familiar with. As a matter of fact, every student in your class probably enjoys cartoons in some form. What they are likely unfamiliar with, however, is using cartoons in the classroom. Utilizing cartoons and comic strips in your classroom is a way to meet students where they are at and allow your goals to combine with their interests."
"The cartoon is amusing.  It has lines that merge into forms.  It is intended for adults as well as children.  There are many characteristics of the artist that lend themselves to an appreciation of this art work.  It may confuse some people, but they have to stick with it."
The cartoon was an interesting concept at first however as it went on got kind of annoying. It had a story line and had a different way of preventing it but the sounds the characters were making were also annoying. I would recommend considering changing the sounds to either no sound all together or something the viewer can understand. The cartoon also felt kind of long for something that wasn't even speaking anything I could understand. I thought the quality of it is was good. I felt like the story was well thought out by the person that wrote it. I also feel like the colors were meant to tell you something as to what the character was feeling but I was unable to figure that out. I felt like overall I would not want to watch this cartoon again as once was enough. 
"The cartoon was certainly engaging. I do not know if this was for children or not, however. The video was in a different language, so it was very hard for me to understand exactly what was going on. There was a debate in my mind about whether or not the characters in this video were angry at one another or if that was just the way the naturally communicate. The colors were also somewhat confusing to me as well. I do not know if there was a meaning behind the color changing or if it was just ""because"". I do not know who was talking to who at times. Overall, I think it was an engaging cartoon, but somewhat confusing!"
"The video was confusing, at best. The majority of the audio is more or less inaudible. I had no idea whether the character was speaking another language, or inventing his own. The point of the video also seems to be unclear. The main character spends it's time interacting with another character that is mostly off the screen, but again this makes the dialogue even more confusing. You can gather that the character is trying to travel, and does accomplish this with multiple vehicles. But again, because the point of the video is unclear, we aren't sure where or why. "
"The video is a bit unique an odd. The concept is interesting, though. The flow of the characters and the entire video itself was seamless. The main character is engaging and interesting to watch. It is unclear what language is used in the video. I think it adds a bit of mystery to it. I think children will enjoy watching this video. It is simple, yet will hold their attention."
"The video was very entertaining holding my attention until the end. The simplicity of the drawing was very imaginative and simple for children and adults. Even though it is presented in some sort of ""other"" language it still made it's point and kept you engaged. The different color backgrounds were a simple way of showing the temperament of the main character at that moment. I liked the idea of using the background along with the language to imagine what I would probably say in any of those situations."
