Very fresh and clean, and it lingers for a while without being overpowering. I love how soft it makes my skin feel, too. It's great to find a soap that doesn?t dry out my hands like many do. I wish they would come out with a refill bottle instead of individual pump bottles, though. But I will continue to repurchase in the meantime!"
2.04E-01,1.00E+00,1.21E-01,2.05E-01,1.32E-01,," I use this soap every day! It's a great value for such a large size- it lasts forever. However, the texture is a little more water-y than I'm used to, so I might switch to the foaming pump version. Smells great, too- pleasantly fresh. I wash my hands a lot always working in the kitchen, and this soap gets rid of any funky smells (even garlic). Probably my favorite scent from this brand. Highly recommend."
2.19E-01,1.21E-01,1.00E+00,1.26E-01,1.54E-01,,"I like to have a nice soap in my office bathroom, so I gave this a try. It?s great, although I would?ve preferred it if the package was glass instead of plastic. Regardless, all the women in my office approve. They say it doesn?t dry their hands skin like other soaps. I?d been buying a more expensive soap before, but no more! This is a much better affordable option. Plus, it?s a nice large size and with an easy-to-use pump that dispenses the perfect amount. Glad to have found this product."
2.29E-01,2.05E-01,1.26E-01,1.00E+00,1.12E-01,,"This soap is in every bathroom in my house and in the kitchen. LOVE the clean smell, it practically makes me want to wash my hands longer. Everyone in my house enjoys it, too. Its smell is incredibly fresh without being overpowering. The dispenser gives the perfect amount and is simple, even for my little ones. Having a good pump just makes it so much easier to use and reduces waste. My one complaint is that I wish the label were more aesthetically pleasing, so it looked a little better sitting on my counter. Such a nice smelling soap deserves a prettier package to be in."
2.57E-01,1.32E-01,1.54E-01,1.12E-01,1.00E+00,,"Ordered online and didn't know what to expect, but I'm pleasantly surprised! Waiting for them to come out with refills for this pump bottle or an even bigger size so I don't have to feel guilty about wasting plastic. That cheap price is just so hard to beat. It's very gentle on my sensitive skin and doesn't seem to dry my hands out as quickly as other soaps. My skin always feels hydrated and smooth after using, even in the winter. It reminds me of the soap with the nice smell you would find in a restaurant or spa. Buy this, it's a steal!"

1.00E+00,0.00E+00,8.71E-02,6.81E-02,7.58E-02,,"Wish I had found this sooner! It goes on smooth, is gentle, and doesn't smell like anything. Most importantly, the ingredients are very natural, and its hypoallergic and cruelty-free. I love supporting more sustainable brands. Would definitely recommend if you want to feel good about your products not harming the environment. Is it being discontinued? I haven't seen it on the shelves for a while. I hope I can find more before I run out. "
0.00E+00,1.00E+00,1.21E-01,9.60E-02,1.19E-01,,"This soap has got a great formula. The lather is just right, even with a small amount. We use it at our preschool and the suds get the kids to wash their hands more. But I've noticed that sometimes the bottle leaks, so make sure to screw the cap on tightly to avoid a mess. Sometimes I put it in a foaming container to make it last longer for the kids. I?m confident knowing their hands are getting clean well and they're happy thinking it's something fun. Glad I stumbled upon this!"
8.71E-02,1.21E-01,1.00E+00,8.49E-02,3.75E-02,,"I'm always on the hunt for a new soap to impress my guests. Then I found this! It is not as thick as other luxury products, so I have to use two pumps to make sure I have enough. But it's still very high quality. It smells like a nice perfume or a garden. It is lovely if you want to treat yourself or a friend a small, unique gift. Very impressed!"
6.81E-02,9.60E-02,8.49E-02,1.00E+00,1.11E-01,,"I don't usually use liquid hand soaps, but I was recommended this. So far, I've enjoyed using this product. A little goes a long way! But no weird residue left over, which is good. However, shipping was expensive and took a long time. I did like that it's made in the US though. I'll probably buy in-stores next time."
7.58E-02,1.19E-01,3.75E-02,1.11E-01,1.00E+00,,"Gets the job done. I've always used this brand, so I trust them. It's a pretty basic soap and leaves my hands feeling clean. Harsh enough to gets the dirt and grime off easily, which is what I was looking for. The dispenser is a little fussy though- It's hard to get the last of the product out from the bottom of the bottle (I had to leave it leaning upside down just to get it out). I can?t complain at such a low price- you get what you pay for. Overall, a good inexpensive option."
