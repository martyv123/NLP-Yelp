"I?ve had a fantastic experience at this school, especially relating to classes and academics because professors genuinely care about students? success. Everyone here is very friendly, and you will find your ?people.? There are so many clubs to get involved with, and they are a great way to meet new people. The one thing I?m not a huge fan of is the location because I prefer larger cities. But there are plenty of ways to keep busy with so many on-campus events. I love the size of campus because it?s a great balance between maintaining that close-together, community feel while also having plenty of buildings. The campus is beautiful while walking between classes. Some of the buildings are a bit rundown and could use some maintenance work, so hopefully that gets done soon. I came into college having no idea what I wanted to do, but I figured out what I wanted to pursue thanks to some of the amazing classes I?ve taken. The student population is diverse, which is nice for classroom discussions and meeting new people. I absolutely love the program I am in and I know that I?m receiving a great education. I am confident that I?ll be able to apply what I?ve learned to my post-grad job. Admin and staff are always helpful and receptive to students? questions and needs. The school provides a lot of networking opportunities to help students get internships and jobs. The food in the dining halls isn?t the best, though. I?ve learned so much at this school through its amazing, incredibly knowledgeable faculty. I am from out of state, so I was nervous coming in, but I immediately felt at home thanks to how welcoming everyone is. There is so much to do on and around campus. There is a student organization or club for everyone, and I?ve made some of my closest friends through Greek life. The school provides you with ample resources to network, learn about grad schools, get internships, and land a job after graduation. It's a good school that offers several majors, so if you decide to change your major you have plenty of options. However, academic advising isn?t very good because it is nearly impossible to meet with your advisor. There is a strong sense of community on campus. We have excellent sports teams and games are always a lot of fun. Classes are challenging and rigorous."
"I have had a good experience in my time at Lowell. I have found the courses I have taken to be challenging and worthwhile. It is good to be at a university where you can tell ( for the most part) that professors truly care about their students and not just a paycheck. I have learned a lot and developed significantly during my time at Lowell. Also, the solution center and their staff has been extremely helpful for me and made my life easier many of times while at Lowell. One negative I would add is that I do not think the advising team does a good job."
I have enjoyed and will continue my experience at this school from the moment I stepped foot on the campus.  
"It is a great state school that offers several amazing courses and provides a great experience in multiple fields. It has several outstanding on-campus communities and opportunities for students who want extracurricular activities relating to either their major or just for fun. The advising system is a little lacking however, with very limited meeting times and not the best communication system for a majority of students. The school also boasts some very good sports teams that provided students a deep connection to the school brand and community. The school's online network is exceptional with easy to manage class managing and a very basic housing registration system that makes it simple and efficient."
"Ive had a great experience here at Umass Lowell, the school offers many different majors and minors. As well as many different clubs and intermural sports teams, which allows many people to meet eachother and become friends. Every professor I've had here have been very nice and helpful, they really want you to successed. They offer so many deals and opportunities for you to attend like sporting events and Co-ops. The campus is really clean and beautiful. "
"Here at UML, you feel like you are at home. Classes here are very fulfilling, and you feel like you are getting the most out of your education. The dorm halls and food courts could use some improvement, but there is such a strong feeling of family here that it over shadows the negatives. I am sure that I will graduate from here knowing I chose correctly!"
"I like the accounting program offered by UMass Lowell. Most professors are very knowable. Although we proud for the diversity in faculties, I do sometimes feel difficult to understand some professors. Most advisors are not helpful at all and I don't like they change my advisors. I prefer build long and stable relationship with one advisor throughout 4-year college. "
"This university has many opportunities for students to participate in. They care a great deal about their students and have proven this numerous times. The university allocates many resources to the students that attend courses including, clubs and organizations, advising throughout the day, free tutoring, a fitness center, and many places for students to feed themselves. The university has many well-known institutions such as the Manning Business School and the Kennedy College of Sciences. Many of the students participate in Division I sports as well."
"I was surprised and delighted by the amount of diversity that umass Lowell has, it was great to make new friends from all sorts of different backgrounds. I do wish the campus was more in a city setting, so there were more opportunities to explore the surroundings, as well as trying new restaurants that would be within walking distance. I?m glad that I get to go a school which offers a good education at an affordable price. There are also many clubs and opportunities that I had not anticipated in being available. I have gotten a great chance to meet new people and get new opportunities. "
I love the school. I have learned so much when I was on campus physically. I like how there are several clubs and sports and many things to do on and around campus. Though there are some professors who are not the best and then there are other professors who are awesome. 
I have had a great experience at UMass Lowell. The professors are very caring and are always looking out for their students. 
"I have enjoyed my experience so far at UMass Lowell. It offers many different majors, but I enjoy the North Campus vibe because I am a business student. The intro business classes are not very enjoyable, so Freshman year is a bit of a drag class wise. It is important to stay focused and keep up good grades despite the classes. Despite being mainly a commuter school, there is a strong community at the University and people are usually willing to talk."
"I am a transfer student, this Spring semester is my first at UMass Lowell. I have had a great experience overall though in the time that I have spent here, but with disregarding the current semester I cannot adequately answer this question."
I've experienced UMass Lowell both as a commuter and as a resident. The school has solid programs and a nice campus. I like how the school is diverse in the sense that there is something for everyone here. 
My experience at University of Massachusetts Lowell has been alright. The campus needs better food options. Also the campus needs to do better with how much they're charging students to park. I also think they need to have more times available for certain classes. I also think that they need to re train some of their advisors. Overall I think Umass Lowell is an alright school.
"Negatives: The mood of the school is honestly depressing. Sophomore year me and a buddy tried to start a club focused on self-improvement, but that got rejected. I got food poisoning from the food 3 times, though it's supposedly improved after I stopped eating there. Positives: The Rowing Club is absolutely fantastic, and they along with other sports teams like Track are very welcoming. When you move in freshman year, make sure to socialize with your floor ASAP, otherwise they'll all shut their doors and you'll never see them again. Advice: Make sure to bring flip-flops for the communal showers, about a quarter of my floor freshman year admitted to peeing in the shower at one point or another."
"Umass Lowell is up and coming school with opportunities in a lot of different areas of study. It gives you the option to really dive into your concentration but also provides a general understanding of each major. The school has a great community with regards to clubs, inter-murals, and other activities. At the end of the day, you get what you put into towards your education. "
"My first semester at UMass Lowell was a fantastic experience. Teachers are looking to provide a challenge for students but also help and nurture their academic performance leading to success. Outside of the classroom, UMass Lowell has a myriad of options regarding extracurricular activities to keep students active mentally and physically. Examples of this could be joining the thousands of clubs on campus, joining an intramural sports team, or attending any of the presentations or lectures conducted on campus. In the end, UMass Lowell is a school tailored around an excellent academic curriculum and wide variety of activities outside of the classroom."
"Overall I have enjoyed the four years at UML and I am very glad that I am graduating very soon. I have met many people people from United Sates and international students with whom I remained friends. I was very happy for the renovation of the business building. Certainly I have missed going to class and see my friends this semester but the school has handled very well the transition to online classes. 
"
"From my limit experience in the school( one semester experience), it is a good school that offers students a convenient study environment, quiet and energetic. It has apparent acdemic atmosphere compared to community school. I started real learning here. Most of professors are professional and good at transferring knowledge and opening idea to their students. The school provides various services to students for broadening their life experiences and development for their future career. I am still learning and percepting everything, the knowledge, the culture, and the people...I cherish the chance of study in the school."
"I was very impressed with Umass Lowell and specifically the Accounting department and faculty.  All of my accounting professors were very knowledgeable and made the classes challenging, but manageable.  I never really became a part of the community, but they always had fun activities or events in the Manning School Building."
"This is my first year at Umass Lowell and so far my experience has been great. This semester is difficult due to covid-19, but the school makes sure students have enough resources to get through this hard time. Some professors are very understanding on the struggles students are facing since turning to online classes."
So far I have had a great experience at Umass Lowell. The environment is very welcoming and a good one to be in. Especially being an athlete there is so much to offer. 
"I really like the fact when I came to UML I was immediately accepted by everyone around me. The classes challenged me to the best of my abilities and made me a better student. The teachers at UML care deeply about their students, and it shows. I enjoyed watching the sports and being a community member. Overall, my 4 years at UML were some of the best years of my life. "
i have learned a lot at umass lowell. many of the programs are amazing and bring so many opportunities that will help every student advance in the far future. they have excellent teams and people all around campus. every teacher pushes you to be the best you can be. 
So far my time at UMass Lowell has been amazing. I just started this spring semester and it feels like one big family. I was in the Air Force before I pursed my higher education and the transition has been smooth. The Veterans office at Umass as been really helpful guiding me on what I need to get them and when. Once classes started all my Professors' have been a huge help when reaching out to them. Can't wait to get back in the classroom with my fellow classmates and continue to grow with them. Thank You All.    
"This is my first year here, to be honest I haven't really enjoyed it! I haven't really truly liked any of my classes to the point that i'm excited to go. I enjoy school, specially being able to control my future. Since I have came to Umass Lowell, all the tutoring centers have been useless to me that I have had to seek outside tutoring that I have to pay for out of pocket. I have had faculty literally tell me to my face that they can't help, as well as not helping me to at least find the right help. My classes are not that exciting and some are extremely hard for me. So to answer your question No I have not had a great year so far at Umass lowell ! The school does have some( tiny percentage) of good things about it. The school sucks to be honest. "
I am a transfer student so this year was my first year at UML.  Even though it was cut short this was an amazing school year.  I have met my best friends here.  There are so many options of majors to study which I think is amazing.  I like the size of the school because the population is on the bigger side but since the campuses are split into three it makes it feel smaller even though its still big.
"I've had a fantastic time here at UML, some of the teachers haven't been that good, but overall, the friendships and experiences I've had had been great. "
"UML is ok.. The scholarships are great, but the campus is dirty, and most of the teachers are awful... The food is gross too... "
So far my experience at the school has been great.  Campus is nice as well as the food.  There's a ton of clubs so everyone can probably find one they like.  Everyone I've met is super nice. The classes are challenging but the teachers I've had are all nice and would help you if you needed it.
I have had a good experience at the school so far. I have a good friend group and have been excelling in my classes. I like the business building because it is new and modern. I am not a fan of the libraries because they are kind of ugly and unenjoyable to work at. I like my dorm USuites. 
I've had a really great time at this school. 
"It was a great strategic choice for me as a school to use my educational benefits. The school is decent in its educational approach. However, the school is extremely politically biased to only one side and it echos throughout its halls. "
"I have had a great experience at Umass Lowell so far! I recently transferred schools this semester, so this is my first semester at Umass Lowell. I live very close so campus, so I grew up seeing the campus change and how much progress and success it had accomplished. I love that the business school has so many majors and classes you can pick from. I also love that the professors are very open and provide us with everything we need to accomplish success. Overall I believe the campus is a great community to be a part of. "
"I've had a great experience at UML so far. I just transferred here for the spring term from Syracuse University, and UML made this transition very smooth. There are a lot of different majors, so there's something for everyone! There are also lots of different ways to get involved on campus which creates a good. sense of community on campus. I truly couldn't ask for a better experience so far."
"As a student who attended UML for the last 4 years, I feel as though my experience was sub par. This could be because I was a commuter who lived off campus, but since I was a freshman I found it hard to integrate myself with other students in my program. I felt as though I wasn't aware of a lot of resources and the advising for my program wasn't the best. It was not until my senior year of college where I felt more confident that I was actually learning things that I would implement in my career and life. Unfortunately, it is my last semester and learning remotely really has dampened my ending experience. "
"I've had a great time so far at UMass Lowell. The class sizes have generally been quite small, which allows for a much more intimate and conversation-inducing setting. In general, I've had very positive experiences with both classes and clubs. The school offers so many helpful resources and a very convenient shuttle service. I do think that there are some very noticeable differences in quality between different advisors on campus -- some are excellent and some seem to have very limited knowledge of how the school works. Despite the number of complaints against the dining hall, I never thought it was that bad. "
It is a great university that has a lot to offer. There are a lot of services there to help you succeed. It is close to where I live so the commute is great. Meeting with your advisor can be challenging. Overall great school.
It is a great school. There is a lot to do. A lot of clubs here for everyone. Big sense of community. Commute isn't far.
"My experience at Umass Lowell thus far has been incredible. This school offers so many fantastic programs whether it be in the classroom or outside the classroom. I have learned so much not just academically, but people as well. As Marty Meehan, Chancellor of Umass Lowell in '13 said; ""Universities are all about the student-to-faculty connection""(Meehan). This has proven to be extremely true, and the skills I have leanred here will make me a superstar in the real world."
"UMass Lowell was always my first choice to go to school due to its close proximity to my home. While attending this university, I've come in contact with numerous diverse groups of professors, peers, and alumni. The campus itself is within a great location, surrounded by restaurants and convenience stores such as Chatime and Eggroll Cafe. I've learned so many new things attending this university, and not all of them are necessarily educational. There are a good amount of clubs and support, providing great networking and interning opportunities. "
"Umass Lowell has been very accommodating with helping me transition from my previous school. The staff are multicultural and its nice to see a diverse teaching staff. Additionally, the councilors work with you to help you make the best of your transfer in classes. The food on campus however is not the best and the traffic regulations around campus is completely horrible. "
"UMass Lowell, thus far, has provided many experiences for me. I have been able to gain knowledge in many different fields. I also have also had opportunities to meet and work alongside a great many people and personalities. The campus community has been great and always has things going on. My only issue is the academic advising/solution center and the lack of meeting times."
"Overall I have found my experience at Umass Lowell to be very positive. Most of the professors that I have are very knowledgeable about what they teach and are willing to help out. I think that the school does a good job of keeping up to date on things that will be useful for students to know when they graduate, and teaching these skills to give students an advantage when they graduate. I have found that many of my professors are willing to help students outside of class, and really care about making sure that students understand certain concepts. The structure of the degree pathways also lets students get a taste of their major early on, without putting them too far behind if they decide to switch. "
"I have loved my experience at UMass Lowell. They have so many different programs and opportunities for students to enroll in. I have particularly enjoyed the community within the Business school, Manning Women in Business and the CO-Op Program. "
"My experience at Umass Lowell has been unforgettable so far. The school has so much to offer, and has a great educational programs. I have made many life long friends due to Umass Lowell and the school has opened up so many opportunities for me. I love the atmosphere around Umass and all the positivity that goes around the campus. I am grateful to say that I am part of the Umass Lowell community and that the community accepts me. "
"It was a good semester that I got to experience in my first year. I got to meet new people and join many Asian clubs, where it was a fun experience to get together with different cultures. UMass Lowell provides many supports for students, where it help me do well in my academics. Even though classes can be challenges at times, but I got through it with resources and friends along the way. "
"It's was a great fall semester for me because I got to meet new people and join different clubs. Even though the school was a challenge, there were resources that help me get through the struggles with classes. UMass Lowell does a great job of providing those resources."
UML is as wonderful campus and a wonderful place to go to school.  I love the PTB building and all it has to offer.  There are many on campus events as well.The advisors work well with the students and help everyone.  The professors are very helpful with all the work given as well.
I love going to UMass Lowell! I am a campus tour guide and love telling perspective students about my experience. I am currently a computer engineering major and i love the program. I love the social aspect and love going to hockey games. I have grown up a lot during my time here and have grown as a student as a person. I can't wait to spend my last two years of college here!
"This school provided me with many opportunities ranging from travel, clubs, and networking events, to skill based workshops. The teachers care about the students and help push them to new limits and achieve their goals. There is an Honor's College that provides students with a chance to take their learning up a level. The staff are all kind and very helpful. There is a decent shuttle system to transport students, however, it isn't always dependable."
During the fall semester i was a criminal justice major so i was on south campus. i did not like it very much so i switched to a business major. i liked business a lot better. the business building is very nice and overall i like how north campus is all connected. i was living on campus at the inn and confrence center and i enjoyed that a lot.
"It was tough to get started and I had many bad experiences, but the people I met and some of the advisors really really helped me get accustomed to the school and gave me the in's and out's keeping me on track. "
"I had a great time at UMass Lowell. I was only here for 3 years and I made a lot of friends after transferring. I had great internship experiences and got involved with great clubs on campus. Some of the teachers weren't great, but overall my experience was really great. I also enjoyed going to many of the hockey games at the Tsongas center."
"My four years at UMass Lowell have been great. I immediately found a solid group of friends to hang out with and I was so happy with the variety of clubs that I could join. What I like the most are the options of fun and interesting classes that I can take for my majors. The professors are extremely helpful and are able to accommodate you to the best of their abilities. They really care! When I needed help figuring out what to do for classes, I was immediately guided through the process from my advisor. I came to UMass Lowell with a slight idea of what to do, but was rewarded with so many different opportunities and now my future is crystal clear."
"So far as it being my first year at UMass Lowell, I've had a great time. Personally wish I had gone to more games but working and going to school full time is a bit difficult but worth it in the end. My academic advising is really good, I am able to be in contact with my advisor and he answers in reasonable time. Classes are a hit or miss depending on the subject and the professors. I do wish some professors were more aware that not every student remembers what they learned in high school so to explain more when bringing up a topic and refreshing our memories is always good. I also wish that professors would at least word finals the same way they word their test due to some students like myself, have a difficult time understanding the material and then left to rot because professors can't help during the exam."
"My experience at UML as as transfer student has been amazing. As a transfer student I was able to accommodate to UML in a smooth manner giving the fact that I already used to balancing college and regular life. Further, the majority of teachers at the manning school of business are really respectful, as well as, caring for their student success not only at school but most importantly in life after graduation. "
I?ve had a good experience at this school. The professors and advisors do a great job of providing a great working environment for students. There is a decent social life for students and there is room for everyone to work through a lifestyle that works best for them.
"I?ve had a fantastic experience at this school, especially relating to classes and academics because professors genuinely care about students? success.However, academic advising is very good because I have an adviser that truly cares. I came from a college that showed students that they weren't worth anything but money in their pocket.  Now I have teachers that care about my success and it is an amazing feeling. "
"My experience has been overall good. There are plenty of options when it comes to choosing a major. A bad thing about this campus is the city that surrounds it due to the fact that it was made to produce textiles in the 1800's which gives the city an old feeling.  Also, the food could need an upgrade, especially at the fox dining hall."
"As a transfer student, I found the classes here to be rewarding as they are challenging, insightful, and provide a great deal of knowledge. The Manning School and Lydon Library are great places to study where I have spent much of my time. I wish they had more outlets in some seats though. As someone who lived in the on-campus apartments I found them to be very nice and comforting. The Merrimack apartment could use a living room portion with a rug and a nice lamp. The RHV one could use a bit more lighting in the bedrooms. As for on-campus entertainment, I did not find myself getting too involved or having fun things to go to where you could easily make friends. "
I really enjoyed being a student at UML. I switched from music to business and enjoyed both majors very much. Professors seem to be as available as they can be and there are many resources available to students. I will miss being here very much.
Umass Lowell has been such a good fit for me for the social aspect and academic aspect. It is the perfect sized school and the classrooms are not to big and not too small. The professors are all extremely accommodating and really want you to be successful in whatever you decided to do. Not to mention they prepare you for your future with job fairs and opportunities. The school has a lot of connections and they are able to help guide you in the right way for you.
"UMass Lowell is a great school and my time here has really allowed me to grow professionally thanks to the great faculty that are always here to support their students. As someone who has considered switching majors multiple times, I always knew I could ask my professors for help if I ever felt unsure about my studies. Although my experience with my advisor during my first year wasn't the best, I had plenty of professors that I could ask for expertise. Additionally, the variety of classes that are offered here really make it easy to make a schedule each semester that fits my needs. One downside I've often encountered during my time here has been the lack-luster campus. The limited options for activities to do or places to get food from close by, as well as the very busy roads often leave campus feeling dull."
"Truthfully, my years with UML have been long and difficult. I have many bumps along the road and found that for the most part, I had to handle everything on my own. I become frustrated with my program when I tried to switch to major in the department and the department lost my application, it took me than a whole year to raise my failing GPA to try and resubmit an application. I was successful but with long nights and rivers of tears, I had to do it on my own. Once becoming part of the department I did not feel a connection with anyone and I felt like professors and faculty were always busy with their own lives and other programs they do not have the time to listen or offer better advising."
"I have learned a lot at this school and there are several resources on campus that are there for your full advantage when you need it most. I find that this is a tough school, however. From what I hear from other people, I believe that UML is a little tougher than what it may seem. This school definitely helps to prepare their students for the real world as well as life after college."
"This school has so much to offer and I'm glad to be apart of it. I grew up in the area and they I joined the Navy and was gone for 9 years and when I came back, the school had expanded way beyond my imagination. To see that much growth and community impact, I couldn't resist the opportunity to earn my degree from UML. The school offers so many classes and campus activities that regardless of living off-campus, I was constantly on-campus joining clubs or sporting activities and events. This school has definitely out performed my own initial intentions and thoughts. "
UMASS Lowell is a very diverse school that is accepting of all people. The professors are generally very nice and try to get to know their students on a personal level. I have yet to have a bad professor. Advising is okay at best; I feel some of the advisors don't care about the student's studies as much as they should. Although honors advising is excellent!
I have really enjoyed studying at the University of Massachusetts. It has given me purpose of life. What I want to become in the future and what my future will look like. There are many friends that have helped go through the hard times. I am more than happy to be here on campus. There are many clubs that you can join and many sports that you can play.
I am very glad that I am in University of Massachusetts Lowell It gives me a purpose of life. I have made many friends. They are very nice. There are many clubs that you can join and many sports that you can play. University of Massachusetts gives me a good future and promises that my life will be all set after I leave from here. 
"The food at UMASS is not good, never has been. I have worked at the Rec and I enjoy interacting with students from all over the world. My transition to a new major was not easy and advising was very unorganized. The faculty advisors do not know anything about the requirements and they do not understand everyone circumstances. Faculty is usually helpful for class work, group work is the worst though."
" I love the size of campus because it?s a great balance between maintaining that close-together, the community feels while also having plenty of buildings. The campus is beautiful while walking between classes. Some of the buildings are a bit rundown and could use some maintenance work, so hopefully, that gets done soon. I came into college having no idea what I wanted to do, but I figured out what I wanted to pursue thanks to some of the amazing classes I?ve taken. The student population is diverse, which is nice for classroom discussions and meeting new people."""
"I just transferred to UML this spring semester, but in the few months that I got to spend my time on campus I have gotten to know many of my peers and staff at UML and all I can say is that everyone here is working hard to be the best at hat they do while still being very welcoming and sociable."
"Studying at UML was a positive experience for me. Changing my major was simple, and most of my advisors were incredibly helpful in assisting me along my career path. Most (not all) of the professors were genuinely likeable and passionate about their field. "
"I've had a great experience with Umass Lowell so far.  My transition from community college to Umass Lowell was smooth.  There were are a lot of resources and help available to me to answer any of my questions.  In general all of the professors Ive had were knowledgeable and great at teaching with the exception of maybe 1 or 2.  I would like to see more dining options for North Campus.  Overall, its been a great experience."
Everyone has done a great job on the move to online
"My experience at this school has been fine. I started on south campus and LOVED it but when I switched majors and ended up on north campus it felt like a completely different school and the more time I spend there, the more depressed I get. The culture on north campus is very unfriendly and the students are very judgmental. I have no idea what the school could do to fix this but spending 3 years taking classes filled with business students on north campus has worn down my mental health considerably and filled me with dread about the type of people I'm going to be working with once I get out of school. "
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my first year at Umass Lowell. From just my first year alone I have learned quite a lot, not only in my studies but within myself. Lowell gave me a place where I could do this. The school offers so much and despite the size seems very concerned about each student individually. I can already tell my future with Lowell will hold so many opportunities to expand my learning in terms of Internships and other offerings on campus. "
"It?s okay, feels very disconnected. I also do not like the parking situation in regards to underclassman having to park very far away from north campus just to take a bus. "
"I feel like I am walking into a safe, and happy environment where there are so many students studying almost anything that you can imagine. I'm inspired to walk through chemistry classes, engineering buildings, and to be able to walking into the Manning building and feel like I am walking into a job at a corporate office. Most of the teachers at UMASS Lowell care about your success and learning. Course schedules are a challenge and this semester I took 6 classes so I'm thankful to be getting good grades. I've made so many friends in different clubs and throughout meeting people who have the same majors as me. I meet new people every day, and learn so much. "
I have enjoyed my academic and athletic experience at Umass Lowell. There are so many programs offered around campus that it would be impossible for someone not to find a group or program that they enjoy and join it. I do wish that the campus was not as spread out and gave more of a campus feel but academically there have been no complaints. I have had fantastic professors who challenge their students enough but also show how much they care about your success after leaving UML.
"I've had a fantastic experience at UMass Lowell. For a fraction of the cost of some other schools, I've met some great friends and found my rhythm pursuing a degree that I'm passionate about. The school offers many optional events and activities to help students network and launch their careers."
"I've had a experience here at Umass Lowell. I was a little nervous at first but once I made new friends and learned the campus, things went right.  My first 2 years I was still finding out what I wanted to do, experimenting in CS but realizing it was something I could not do.  Switching Majors was a simple process and has put me in a better position. I am happy to be here. "
Umass lowell is a fairly interesting place that can certainly keep you busy even if you are not looking to be that way. I do enjoy the learning that I get on campus. The professors seem as genuine as they can be. I am mainly looking forward to the later years where I get to study classes relative to my major.
"My experience at Umass Lowell has been good. I transferred here and started a new major and I think the Manning School of Business is great and have reiterated my love for Marketing. The Credit transfer process can be a little strange and haven't quite figured that out. But I'm glad i""m here and wish I did all 4 years in this program at UML. "
"As an online student at UMass Lowell, I am very pleased with the organization of each class and the interactive experiences it has to offer. There was quick feedback for questions and group discussions on the material for the week. Through UMass Lowell, I was able to complete my school work on my own time, while continuing to be a full time employee. "
My first semester at UMass Lowell was an incredible experience. I learned more about how the general business world works more than I ever thought I could. I also have gained more independence and more confidence in my work ethic abilites. I have also made a multitude of friendships and made fantastic memories on campus and at the hockey games as well. I hope to enagge in more campus activities and job oppertunities in the future.
"I feel as if I learned more this year compared to previous semesters as all of my classes are business related as opposed to last year when I had many pre reqs such as college writing, difference makers seminar and some history and social science classes. I felt as though my professors were very knowledgeable and helpful with regards to assisting me in learning the required material. The only gripe I have against UML is the food in the dining halls, however I do understand that it is not a simple process in improving food quality for the whole university. "
"My experiences at UMASS Lowell is amazing. It is a diverse university and a great opportunity to meet new people and network. I enjoy going to class and making my own schedule. The courses can tend to get difficult but it keeps me motivated. The study rooms and libraries are my favorite places to be. I enjoy group studies and meeting up with people to do homework together. Overall, I am happy that I attend Umass Lowell. "
" I transferred to UMass Lowell about a year ago and everything just fell into place once I did. I feel more challenged in classes and I love my university's student community. We have a little bit of everything, and all students have a place to do what they like. I loved playing club volleyball and living on campus last year. "
When I first visited UML I was very unsure about attending. After my first week at school I started to get comfortable and make school feel like home. The other students and faculty really helped make this happen because everyone is very friendly for the most part. There is a very strong sense of community. 
"I am graduating this spring, but it has been the weirdest end to a school year I could have ever imagined. With the coronavirus pandemic, everyones world has turned upside down. Some teachers are pretending its not happening and continuing on with classes is if nothing has changed and others are very understanding and helpful. This is not the way I expected to finish my college experiences but it will sure be one to remember."
"UMass Lowell is good because of the variety of options when it comes to choosing majors. Also, it has a large student body so it there is a lot of diversity. The bad thing is that lowell is an old town and there's not a ""new vibe"" to it. Also, it's far from boston so you are essentially stuck here."
I choose Umass Lowell largely due to the price and the fact that we da be in Plastics Engineering. I have enjoyed my time at Umass Lowell but it has been more hard work than anything. Although the hockey games are pretty dope. I am confident that I will be more than prepared for the industry that I am heading into thanks to Umass Lowell. 
"I had overall a good time at Umass Lowell. During my four years at this school, I met incredible people who helped me become the person I am today. I have learned more than I could ever imagined. I learned about architecture, political science, social justice and and so on. I am going to miss walking around campus and in Lowell. I miss already our hockey team. I think any upcoming freshmen will love our diverse population and the city of Lowell which is very calm and very friendly."
"I transferred here from UMASS Amherst and I think the classes at Lowell are really great, all of my classes have been really small and the professors are nice. However, compared to Amherst, UML is seriously lacking in their efforts to engage students with potential employers and prepare us to enter the workforce. Also, Lowell isn't a very nice city and the different campuses can make scheduling classes difficult because going back and forth from North to South is a little unrealistic. Finding clubs to join at UML is also pretty rough, compared to Amherst there are barely any clubs here and not many of them are very interesting or relevant to what I want to do or hobbies I have. Other than that some of the newer buildings are really nice but a lot of them are on the older side. "
"I?ve had a good experience at UMass Lowell, in fact i was excited to start my education at this school and it wasn't a disappointment. I have experience all a student can to transient from teenager to adult. I had some though times as well as great time, I met wonderful friends and professor. Umass Lowell will always stay in my heart, and I'm grateful for everything it taught me.  "
"The size of the campus allows all it's students to find new people every day to interact with. The wide variety of different cultures at UML really opens my eyes to understanding people better and see what other people go through in their daily lives. There are tons of different majors to choose from so whatever you're interested in studying, UML most likely will be able to provide you with the resources necessary. Classes are interesting and engaging. The advisors try their best to meet with everyone individually and discuss classes on short notice."
"The first semester of college was not as bad as I thought. All of my professors were really nice and understanding. College was not like what my teachers in high school said it would be like. I was able to make new friends from different countries and cities. Even though I chose a school close to home, I still love it here.The clubs that they offer herr and fun and creative as well."
I have had a great experience at UML so far. The classes are engaging and informative and the campus is very nice. The sports games are fun to attend. It is very unfortunate that we can not spend the Spring Semester on the campus.
"I have had a great experience so far here at UMass Lowell. I love the culture that this school brings and all of the new people I have met. I have come to understand that the professors and staff here really care about the students and want to see them achieve success. There is always something to get involved in on campus, whether it be clubs, guest lectures, or performances. UMass Lowell is a wonderful place to further your education and try to reach your goals. "
"I love what the Manning School of Business has to offer me as a student and opportunity wise. The teachers are very much engaged and show interest in their student's success. I also love the family feels that the college brings and the number of events and opportunities around campus to get involved. The university also feels small even though there are a large number of students just because of how easy it is to interact and make friends. I love the advisors and how much they are invested in their students, it really shows in the way they reach out."
"UMass Lowell offers many academic and professional opportunities for students to succeed. There is a strong support system for students and it is easy to develop positive relationships between professors and staff members. There are many programs offered such as co-op which allows students to gain work experience while being in school. Although it is a large school, there is a sense of community within the campus which created an easy transition for me during my freshman year. The campus community is diverse and there are many activities to do there. "
"UMass Lowell is a good school with plenty of opportunities for students to be successful in courses and in the real world. The food is not great, and the freshman housing is shameful, but its rigorous programs make up for that. "
"I love UML! The staff is beyond helpful and the professors are there to teach you. Yes you can get a bad apple but the others make up for it. Classes are generally small and teachers will make the effort to know you not just as a number. The individual programs are well funded and support all students. Clubs and sports are plentiful and there are many perks of being a student whether it be through the networking or alumni. The price is somewhat affordable and there are many scholarships to choose from. Not to mention the co-op, internships, research studies and study abroad opportunities they have to offer. "
"My first semester was not great. I lived in the ICC with a bad roommate. I felt very isolated from the rest of the school because I would not go and walk around. I would always have to take the buses and the buses did not have a good schedule at all. School wise I did well, I enjoyed most of my classes, and I do like the school very much just not my living conditions. "
I really feel like I belong to a community here at UMASS Lowell. I've had some many opportunities and the professors are very helpful. Some applications like job hawk and SIS can be confusing and crash at times but that might be expected for a public school. Some advisors are there just to tell you what you have to do and leave rather than helping out but there are people that really care about your success and well being. I like the extra activities and rec center and there are a lot of different resources for almost everything that you'd need. 
Umass Lowell does a good job to ensure students are accounted for given with how many people are at the school. There is a real sense of caring. I was impressed how much attention i was given and if i needed help it was always there
"I've had an experienced filled time here at the university. I have learned from professors with enormous experience in the industries they have worked in. The campus is not the largest, but also not the smallest. The distance between North Campus and South Campus is the perfect distance to get fast around. Our school spirit is great as we have talented Division 1 teams in several sports. The classes here are rigorous and challenging for many reasons across all the majors. The people that you find in the university are worth meeting with a good community surrounding them.."
"When I chose UMass Lowell I had no idea I was about to have such amazing experience. As an international student, I didn't know what to expect from universities in the US. UML matches well with the quality of education in this country. I am glad I chose to study business here, the building is the latest facility on campus. The campus isn't huge, which is perfect for me because traveling across the campus doesn't take much time. The amount of resources given to students are UML are unbelievable. Especially as an international student, I felt welcome here and easy to blend in. "
I really enjoy this school. The people here are fantastic once you can coax them to get out of their shells. I find the Professors to be extremely engaging and very open to help and chat with students after class hours. Not only are there a wide variety of majors but most programs excel on the nation standings which is extremely beneficial for your resume.  
"I really enjoy the library, I am able to study in peace without too many distractions.  The Manning School of Business is in a great location to spend time in while I'm taking a break between classes.  I have had several great teachers so far who have helped me through the semester and transition from military to student.  The layout of the Manning School is great in that I never have to worry if I will make it to a class on time or not.  Everyone is great."
"It's a good school that offers several majors, so if you decide to change your major you have plenty of options. However, academic advising isn?t very good because it is nearly impossible to meet with your advisor. There is a strong sense of community on campus. We have excellent sports teams and games are always a lot of fun. Classes are challenging and rigorous.

"
I thought that the young brains here at UMass Lowell were quite engaging and the community of ResLife was awesome! The fact that the major female majors and male majors were on completely different campuses definitely seemed like a planning error on the university's end. Overall I just came here for an education and that is what I got. Definitely good diversity! Also loved the fact that campus was sustainable.
"I transferred to UMASS after I got my associate's degree at another school. I wish I had transferred earlier because I like the school environment more than my other school. I have enjoyed my classes and experiences, and I would recommend others to go here. My only negative experience was with advising, the academic advisors assigned to me were no help and couldn't answer any of my questions, and one of them never even replied. Luckily, I was able to get in contact with professional advisors who helped me. Overall, it was a really good experience!"
I have had an amazing experience at the school. It has a very welcoming community and it was a nice change of scenery. They offer so many great programs to assist you in learning and even more programs to further your learning. I couldn?t have asked for a better school to go to.
"UMass Lowell has been my home for two year. I really like that they make the transfer system seamless for students who have to pave their own way and pay for their education out of pocket. Overall my classes were good but sometimes classmates and I would become a little irritated by the fact that our professor's verbals and written communications would be riddled with spelling and grammatical errors (although we understand English isn't a lot of their first languages--just a little off-putting when you regress from a high school level). Social life is a little bleak on campus due to the geographical divisions of the campuses, but overall it is a good education. I'm excited for my future post college and super ready to move to the next stage of my life! Also thankful for my opportunity to be on the Dean's list and inducted into ODK."
UMass Lowell offers a good education at an affordable cost for in state students. This is hard to come by nowadays since college has gotten so expensive everywhere. If you take advantage of all the resources on campus you will have a great experience. I played sports for 4 years here and one of the best things about school was that many classes were offered online so I could work around my difficult schedule.
UMass Lowell is doing a great job at changing the reputation of the city of Lowell. I love this historical value of this university! I also appreciated how the university allowed me to engage and become part of the community through ODK and ResLife. Overall I wasn't really seeking fun from college and that worked out fairly well since UMass Lowell definitely is a little lacking in the social aspect (at least on North campus). Overall very pleased to be finishing up and shifting to the next stages of my life. 
"There are so many things I love about this school. I love how versatile the academics are, as it was easy for me to change my major several times, and still be in an excellent program. The culture of the school prepares students well for the workforce, and especially encourages students to participate in the workforce as a part of their education. The students here are to proud to be a part of the UMass Lowell community- it is evident at the hockey games and other sporting events, where students, faculty, and staff are all proud to cheer on their fellow River Hawks. Living on campus was a fantastic experience where I was able to meet so many wonderful people, and all the Resident Life staff were to welcoming and helpful in the adjustment in living away from home. I have found all of my classes (in several different disciplines) to be challenging, but led by professors that prioritize their students growth, knowledge, and success. "
"I love this school and the campus; I feel very comfortable being part of UMass Lowell. I feel like some professors try to be understanding and try to help you when you are having a difficult time understanding the material. Classes can be pretty challenging and can even pique your interest that it can impact your future career choice. I feel like the school has a lot to offer, especially when it comes to trying to find the major that best fits you. "
"I love the school truly. Picking this school kinda always felt natural. It was close enough to home where I can visit, yet far enough where I dont feel like Im still in the same place. This school supports all the students tremendously from the second they enroll til they graduate. All the staff are so welcoming and so eager to help."
"For the most part, I have enjoyed my experiences so far at UML. I think most of that has to do with joining Greek Life. I have been able to make amazing friendships and have received so much support from my org. This has been especially important to me being from out of state with no friends prior to enrolling and having a bit of a difficult first semester. On the other hand, the dining has shown to be less than approvable with obvious health concerns and my residence hall had a pretty bad mouse problem."
I have really like this school so far as I'm in my sophomore year. I feel I am learning a lot in classes and professers have been great. I would have to say my experience with advising has not been good and I look elsewhere for help in what classes I should take. I only use advisor to get hold off my account. Other than that my experience with this school has been great.  
I have had a good experience at this school. The proffesors at the University of Massachusetts Lowell care about the student's success. Most of the students are friendly and there are a lot of clubs and activitis you can take part of. I like how UMass Lowell is in the city of Lowell. There is a lot of things you can do in the city of Lowell.   
"The school feels as though it is providing me a quality education, at a price that I feel is affordable. I feel confidant in my ability to get a job once I graduate in order to be able to pay off my student loans and save up for big life events like a home, a family and retirement. The sports games are great to go to, as they provide skill and entertainment for many here at a high level. I do think that the food quality, cost of meal plans and parking passes leave a lot to be desired, and are overpriced for the service that they provide to students and faculty alike. This is especially in comparison to our sister school, UMass Amherst, who rates amongst the best campus dining food in the country, as opposed to UMass Lowell, who has been frequently getting people demanding change to improve their quality"
I have enjoyed my time on campus. Although I do wish it was not so spread out it is easy enough to get around. The professors are quite amiable in my experience coming from an array of diverse backgrounds. The biggest downside on campus was definitely the lack of quality food.
I've enjoyed my time at UMASS as an online student and feel well prepared for an upcoming career. I have two courses left this summer to graduate with a bachelor's degree in business administration and I am proud to obtain my degree from UMASS. 
"I truly enjoy the program I am currently enrolled in to the point that I want to attend graduate school here. The professors are great and have given me so much industry knowledge. The collaboration among students has also been a major positive as well. I liked attending sporting events with other students also as the teams are very competitive and entertaining. Overall, I can't ask for much more from my academic experience. "
"I enjoy that school administrators keep the new fields on east campus lit up all night.  It's like Christmas year round! Meanwhile a half dozen friends of mine lose their work study in the library, money that they rely on to come to school.  Chairs with wheels in the library?? What a time to be alive. Who cares if they won't splurge on computers in the Civil Engineering Lab that can actually run the software we need?"
"I have had a great experience here, academically, socially and otherwise. Some things I like about the school is the variety of classes offered, the atmosphere on campus, the multitude of clubs and sports offered as well. All in all there are many opportunities here to try new classes or activities and the school offers the resources to do so. There are also things that frustrate me, such as the lack of spending and funding to many departments, and what seems to be a focus on the administration to spend a lot of money on irrelevancies instead of academics (or the dining hall). The hockey team has their own private gym which puts the one in riverview to shame, however the music department can barely keep the practice room pianos in tune. It is also frustrating to the administration talk about struggles students can face financially and that they want to help, yet renting a textbook from the bookstore for the semester can cost me $120."
"My experience in this college has really turned my life around in only one semester. I had a tough time in high school coping up with everything. However, after coming to UMass Lowell, I gained self-confidence, determination for my academics, having a great social life and truly reaching towards my potential. I came here initially because of its wide option of majors, and I took advantage of this when i changed my major into something I loved, which my advisor helped me a lot for. I have enjoyed everything; from the dining halls to my own dorm room. The diversity of clubs and extracurricular activities helped me choose clubs and organizations of my liking, and I am now actively participating in them. I was lost before coming here but after coming here I found myself again, and I have nothing but good words about this institutions. "
"Overall I like UMass Lowell despite a lot of things I personally dislike about the school but that's just me personally. I do not like how North and South campus are so separate and I feel like there's a whole other part of campus that I don't know about. I am not a huge fan of the dining at UMass Lowell. Although I really like all the professors I've had and all the club options at the school. I am hoping to join more clubs once school starts again in the fall. And one of my favorite parts about the campus is the new Business building, I love sitting in there and getting my work done. "
"I had a wonderful experience at this great institution, although, there have been a few challenges here and there in relation to tutoring. "
"Overall, I can easily say that I've had a good experience at UMass Lowell. From the orientation leaders to the clubs to the RAs, everyone there always manages to help you feel at home. There is a very good sense of community. If I would have one complaint, I would go with the obvious and say the dining halls could definitely be improved upon. Things are going up, but there is definitely room for improvement."
"My experience at the school so far has been mediocre. The course load and teaching has been noticeably improved after signing up for Honors courses. However, outside of classes has been nothing of interest to me. Regarding parties and social life, there has been no aspect of fulfillment for my life on campus. The recreation center is great though since it offers a ton of sports and options for strength conditioning. The campus itself is clean and pleasant to be in, but it has been hard to find a footing with other people. Despite the pessimism, it's hard to gauge where I would be in life without college, so it's great to be thankful (However, it sucks not having time to not work. This can change eventually once the course load gets reduced).  "
"Switching from a community college to a four-year university, I would say my experience at this school is much better. There are so many clubs that you can choose from, making it easier to find one you fit in. I made so many friends after joining a few cultural clubs and having friends on campus makes it easier to navigate classes when you have a few in each class. There are so many options if you need help and there is always someone available to help in the tutoring center. I love the campus because it is close to home and great for commuters. "
"After 15 years of being out of school, I was excited and nervous to go back to school. My academic advisor was extremely helpful with my course selections and continues to check-in with me during the school year. The professors that I had made the class enjoyable and was always available if I had questions. The various clubs and organizations offered for the students were great for social interactions and academic growth. I am enjoying my time here so much that I decided to continue with the Masters program after I get my Bachelors Degree."
My experience at UMass Lowell has been great. I have learned a lot in the classes and from other students. Being a college student has helped me become more independent and mature. The faculty at the school are very helpful too. There are many majors to choose from.
I have had a great experience at this school. I love this school because it is a very large school that offers a lot of diversity. This school has offered me many opportunities to grow such as the co-op program. I have felt that this school has helped me grow as a person. Mainly due to people like my advisors and my friends who have helped me throughout my classes.  
I am very happy with the education that I got here. The professors care a lot about their students and how to help them improve their academic performance. I also love the school spirit and the many sports events that are offered. The free t-shirts and giveaways were a nice add-on. I also gained a lot of knowledge from the career services.
"I am a transfer student and Spring 2020 is my first semester in Lowell. I am studying accounting and the business school is amazing. I liked both the studies and the dorm life (friends). The professors and advisors are nice. However, i didn't like the attitude of the Residence life people. Not only they take forever to reply to an email, but they try to put blame on you for their fault. I experienced that with more than one person and I think that is very wrong."
Going back to school to finish my degree at age 36 was a tough decision. However it is the best decision I have made. I have learned so much. I feel that I will be ready for a new career path one that will challenge me in a career that I am excited for. I think that the opportunities that UML can open for me will really help me get to where I want to be in life. 
I really did not know what to expect coming to this school. I initially was a little bit intimidated about getting into college and Lowell also seemed like a scary city to live in. However not being there right now makes me realize how much I miss being at school. I have made some of my best friends in the world at school and have countless memories that will stay with me forever at school. If I was to change anything about the school it would be to make the campus feel a little more closed off and separate and connected more. I have really enjoyed my time at school and I am glad I made the choice to go here. The classes for the most part are interesting and taught by professors who are experts in their respective fields and really seem to care. 
So far UML has been nothing but amazing. Sure Fox Dining can use some help but other than that it's great. Grateful for the faculty and students that help me along the way. I'm someone who likes to be challenged and the classes here are just that. Can't wait for Rona to be over to head back. RIVERHAWKS!!  
"It is a good school full of great teachers. However, I have had a bad experience with advising. They have many different clubs and it's very easy to join. The tutoring center is awesome if you find the right person who knows the material you working on. Overall, I think my school is nice because of the diverse professors and students."
"It?s very hard to adjust as an international student, after the first year it seems as if the school doesn?t care anymore. I was able to change my major and it is going great, but I have begun to notice that as I progress further in my major the quality of education diminishes, be it in translation or guidance from academic advisors. But the aspect that has gotten me to think about my prospects if how people just end up adjusting to what they get. I have had a number of friends transfer for that reason. "
I honestly very much enjoy the university. I find there is so much to do on campus from courses to activities and clubs. They have a lot of different fields of study and some really interesting courses you are able to take. 
"This place is really interesting, at first I didn?t know my way around but now I know the north campus almost like the back of my hand. I?ve had some good teachers and some not so great ones. The atmosphere is interesting and there are lots of interesting people. The new business building is my favorite part of the campus. It?s very modern and beautiful in design."
I had a good time at Umass Lowell. I didnt like it at first but after a while it grew on me. Made some friends and made some good memories. CLose to home too so its easy to go home too.
"UMass Lowell was always my number one school.  I enjoy the campus diversity, activities and plethora of resources that are offered.  I never feel like I'm alone in my educational journey and there are people all around to support me.  I've met some incredible students and professors who have made my experience at UMass Lowell worthwhile.  I've been challenged, I've discovered what I like and dislike and I've prepared myself for life to come post-college. "
"I have enjoyed my time at this university so far. There are a lot of opportunities for students. They have a big number of clubs and organizations that you can join and for people of different interests. There are also many events you can attend, from academic to sporting events. The classes are challenging but the professors actually care about the students and are willing to help during class or their office hours."
I have been pleasantly surprised at how comfortable the transition to college was at UMass Lowell. My first year has been a journey of gaining knowledge as well as learning about what I truly like to study. UMass Lowell has allowed me to align my strengths with the right pathway for my future. I also play on the hockey team here and we love our fans!
"I really enjoy UMass Lowell. I think it is a great school, offers a good variety of majors. The campus' are pretty nice, and ongoing renovations are only making them better. I have seen great upgrades over the past three years. I have had great positive experiences with professors, and the large majority have shown to care about myself and my education. The sports teams are pretty good, definitely room for improvement there, understandable with the recent transfer to division 1. Overall great school and would speak positively of it to others. "
"I am currently in accounting program and I absolutely love it. The professors are very knowledgeable. The campus is nice. The foot court is not. The academic advising needs improvement. I don't like they change my advisor every year. I prefer to stay with one advisor and build stable, long relationship."
I have had a great experience at UMass Lowell.  Living in the dorms has been great and the courses I've been taking all have been very interesting.  Life on campus is also a lot of fun whether it's hanging with my teammates or just going to the dining hall after class there's always someone around and something to do. I have learned a lot from the school not just about what the classes are being taught but also more about who I am as a person.  
"Umass lowell is just a another college and theres nothing more too it. The teaching is fine, I've had some really great professors, and some very bad ones. I feel the more niche your major is the better the teachers are, and the more broad (business) the worse they are.  "
University of Massachusetts of Lowell was a great college choice. I have made many memories and friends that will last a life time. The teachers were very kind and made sure every kid felt important. I wish that the school administration took more time with the students. I felt that concerns I had were pushed aside or sent to someone else to deal with. I wish the school heard more of my concerns and made them fell accounted for. 
"I like Umass Lowell it's definitely a good school for me. The business program seems to be very strong and I love the community in the school. All my professors seem to know a lot about the subject they are teaching and have provided adequate work. However the dorms are very strick, only being able to have 2 guests in your room is very frustrating.  "
"I don't really like being here.  This school probably has the worst biomedical engineering program in the country.  Even some general engineering classes, like Physics, are taught horribly.  I'm not the only one who thinks like this - all my friends who are in engineering majors are dissatisfied with their general classes.  The only good things I can think of at UML are the business classes I've taken, the honors English class, and the city of Lowell itself."
Overall I have had a pleasant experience at UML.I've made lots of valuable connections with both my peers and professors and faculty. I have taken advantage of career fairs and other networking resources that the school has offered and I believe these will help me get a job after graduation. I have also been active in the student organizations within the Manning School of Business. These organizations are extremely beneficial for meeting new people and gaining more experience.
"I came into this school as a criminal justice major, 5 years later I am graduating with math major and cj minor. This school has given me everything from a club family to a life time mentor.Teachers are very knowledgeable and passionate about their respective fields. "
Going to college at UMass Lowell has been an interesting experience. It?s been difficult to figure out what major i wanted to pursue but the college helped me to figure out what i wanted to study and push towards for a career. It has not always been easy but with the help of teachers and friends i am making it happen. The price of the school was a major factor in why i chose the school as well as the academics. I really did enjoy my college experience and I am exited to go into the workforce with all the knowledge I have acquired. 
"It's a good school that offers multiple majors and fun campus life! I always appreciate how approachable my advisor was. It means a lot to me that he check in with how things are going and whether I can get better performance, because the school can get pretty stressful. Also, many professors in Business major were keeping us engaged, learning and laughing. A simple thanks may not be enough, but I?m still sending this note to express my heartfelt gratitude."
I have had a smooth and exciting experience at UMass Lowell. There are opportunities to succeed around every corner with people eager to see you succeed. The level of education for the price is unrivaled in this area. I am always impressed with the work ethic of students here. There is a down-to-earth atmosphere that you don't find at every school.
"My experience here has been pretty decent. The education is really good and professors are helpful. I have lived on campus since freshman year and that has definitely helped my step put my comfort zone and meet new people. However, I feel like it's hard to fit in and relate to people. Overall, I am satisfied with my choice of coming here, it has introduced me to great people and opportunities. "
"Overall I have had a great undergraduate experience here at UMass Lowell. Entering as a freshman, I was definitely nervous to start college, but was surprised by how warm and welcoming everyone is. I feel over the years I have grown and learned so much, which I can accredit to the experiences and education I've received at this university. Most of the professors I've had have been nice, are passionate about what they do, and want to see their students succeed. In addition, I feel as a student here, that I have gotten familiar with the city of Lowell as well and was able to make it my second home, which otherwise would not have happened had I not went to school at UML."
I have had a great experience at University of Massachusetts Lowell. It has given me purpose in my life. It has helped me to find a direction towards my future. University of Massachusetts Lowell has a great campus. There is recreational center that keeps you fit. There are so many clubs and groups that you can join and make friends.  University of Massachusetts Lowell offers many different courses. It gives students a sense of home especially those who have come from far away places. These international students enjoy their lives on campus. 
UML is a great place to try new things. I myself recently joined a few clubs to do after school activities and make new friends. I got to make some memories there and try out new activities in the gaming club and work out in BJJ. It has been a good use of my time left over from classes. I wouldn't spend my time any other way!
UMass Lowell is an upcoming University that has the potential to well-known for majors other than engineering. The Manning School of Business has been getting more and more investments put into it and will become more well-known in the coming years. The school also has a strong sense of community as everyone here is proud that they are here. All the professors are very nice and super helpful when you seek help. The school is just overall a good place to call your school.
"I think the school itself is very good. The professors are very knowledgeable and actually want to help you succeed. They offer a variety of classes and degrees and want to help you to your goal. Since I commute to school I never really made any connections here so it was hard for me to be too involved but other than that so far, I've had a great experience. "
"This freshman year has been a life-changing experience, I have met so many amazing people. A majority of my professors were amazing, and I have learned so much in the business school. This year has helped form me into the person I am today and I can not wait for next year."
"Academic advising is the worst part of my UML experience, they don't know what they are doing and don't seem to care. Professors are mostly very caring and try their best. I chose UML for financial reasons and was not my first choice. However my experience has been mostly positive and I do not regret my selection."
"I transferred my junior year so discounting spring 2020 I was only here for fall 2019. I came from North Shore Community College and compared to the teachers there I was very disappointed with my educations here at Umass Lowell. There was only one professor that I was actually impressed by (William Clark) and felt was worthy of the increased price tag compared to NSCC. The rest of them felt far less skilled at actually teaching (terrible at explaining the subject or had little interest in the students learning) or in some cases less knowledgeable in the actual course material. For example, Josh Levy, I'm shocked this dude is allowed to teach, I have never seen a professor that had so little ability to teach anything. this is something that the entire class agreed on. I've never looked at a white board and felt a whole month behind. It felt like all he really cared about was creating inside jokes with students in the front row. UML should honestly be paying the youtubers who explain everything perfectly clearly in 15 minutes than he failed to do over a couple weeks. I totally understand that in college, students need to take initiative and learn outside of class but that class should reinforce that not worsen my understanding. Even in my other classes, excluding Professor Clarks, it honestly felt like if a student was running a high school class with less to cover. I really wasn't impressed with my education. I'm sure some of the other professor were very knowledgeable but that knowledge is utterly meaning less if they don't encourage discussion that could show their knowledge or they can't convey it. I, along with most likely every other student would rather have a professor that was really good at teaching rather than someone really smart and can't teach or, even worse, is forced to teach in order to continue their research or whatever. That hurts our education severely."
I think UMASS Lowell is an excellent school providing a plethora of options for students to succeed. I have had many professors who have been very helpful in providing advice that I will use when making professional decisions for the rest of my life. There are so many opportunities to meet new people and especially to surround yourself with driven and thoughtful people. Even in my freshman year when there were seemingly millions of 2 AM fire drills at Fox Hall I still loved the incredible sense of community I found in my peers. Most students here are very smart and very helpful.
When I transferred into Umass Lowell three years ago I was unsure which major I would choose to study for my degree. After changing majors twice prior I was determined to find a field of study that I was truly interested in. The advising team in the Manning Business School building was very helpful when exploring all my options. As I prepare to graduate I can confidently say the advising team at Umass Lowell is one of the things that stands out at my time here.
I have had a good experience at this school. I found some of my instructors are not that good at teaching while others are very good. I have had a good time in dealing with the guidance Department. Some of my teachers have helped in creating friendships with others. The online transition after Covid-19 has been quite difficult. I find my depression growing with little concern from the school regarding mental health concerns during this time. 
unfortunately I transferred here in the spring 2020 so I can't write anything about my experience 
Umass Lowell is a school of creativity. The school is what you make it. I believe this school has provided me with the advantages that can help me achieve my goal. I am creating something for myself that would provide a with the chance to start a family and achieve everything I say I can. I will achieve
I liked UML because it offers a lot of benefits to the students. It has great environment so everyone can succeed and learn new information. I liked the size of classes because it?s bigger than my previous school. They have a lot of resources to find co-up and internship.
I have really enjoyed my time at Umass Lowell. The opportunities to pursue your goals are infinite and I truly feel that I am here to learn the material rather than being pushed to merely get the passing grades. The faculty here are very helpful and supportive.
I love the education I have been receiving at UMass Lowell. The teachers really care about their students and their learning. Many of my professors have even reached out to me after I have taken their class to see how I am doing. I like how the campus is set up and how safe I feel when walking to class or to my dorm. I am very happy because I know my education from Umass Lowell will help me get a job in the future. 
"I love that UMass is a big school. It has been great meeting people from neighboring cities and different backgrounds. The campus is spread out over the city, which I personally love. Lowell has always been home to me, but I see it very differently now that I have completed my first semester. I have made so many friends and connections so far, and this is only the beginning. "
"Umass Lowell has given me a great college experience. I have had more opportunities than I could have ever imagined. Not only have I grown academically, but I have also grown socially. I learned to venture outside of my comfort zone going on a study abroad program and joining Greek life. I would not trade my college experience at Lowell for anything."
"I like the experience that Umass Lowell offers. They have a lot of major options split between two campuses. They have very good resources to help students like career services, knowledgeable advisors and more. They helped me a lot when changing my major and figuring out my career path. The campus has a wide variety of clubs and other offering to get you involved in things your interested in."
"I really enjoy attending school here. The college of engineering is excellent, and I have had no issues with teachers. I haven't had a problem with the food or the housing ether. I enjoy my major (Chemical Engineering) and I am considering a masters degree from UML. Also I enjoy how well the co-op program is run and I'm looking forward to participating in it next year."
"My experience with UMass Lowell has been great! I love the atmosphere, the vast options you're provided with for choosing a major, the support you receive from your peers and professors, and much more! I had the pleasure of being on student government and various other groups and clubs on campus. I will always treasure these memories and be thankful for my experience at UMass Lowell - for making me who I am today."
"It's a good school with several career paths and academic advising that helps you. Great size campus. Student population is very diverse, which is nice when meeting and discussing with new people. There are many clubs to get involved in and networking opportunities."
"Being a transfer from a much smaller school, I was nervous. But after being here for about two years, I am a lot more comfortable. They offer a wide variety of majors and different of classes. They also offer a bunch different clubs either major focused or just general interest. One of my big worries I had when transferring here was that the classes are gonna be very big and that the teachers would not care. It is the opposite, most of the classes I have taken don't reach over like 50 people. "
"I am really thankful every day that I ended up choosing to come to UMass Lowell and staying here. As a high school student, I had a perception that private universities would provide a better education and learning environment than public universities. However, my experience at UML has been amazing. As a graduating senior, I am confident that everything I have learned will have some sort of application after I graduate, whether in academics or in personal life. My professors and peers are world-class and some of the most intelligent and thoughtful people I have ever met. I am forever proud to be a riverhawk."
"I absolutely love UML. The administrators, the professors, and even the students are great. I always got the help I needed. I appreciate that the school always provides as many helpful sources as they can for their students. I feel important to them."
"I really love this school, especially the amazing view along the river. At first, I was nervous about my future life in school, but all instructors are friendly and helpful and help me a lot. Also, the design of campus is also interesting. Each part of campus has  their own feature. However, it's a little bit far between each campus. Though, there are bus stops in campus, it is also inconvenient for students who doesn't have own vehicle. Anyway, this school is really good and   I hope it will be better."
"This school has many opportunities to go beyond just the coursework. Most of the professors are great with only a few outliers that you want to avoid. The academic advising is the worst I have ever seen, so do not expect anything out of that department and do it yourself. I loved the people I met and the friends I made while here, you can really find yourself here. The food has slowly gotten better over the years but I would stay cautious when getting any meat or salad from the dinning halls. Overall I loved the experience and will miss it."
"After transferring two times I can finally say I am at a school I love. There are so any ways to get involved on campus which has truly heightened my experience. Joining a sorority has allowed me to give back to so many organizations and make a difference. Events like the St. Jude Fundraiser have been my favorite moments of my college experience. At UML I know that I can reach out to advisors, professors, and my peers for anything because they care about my success while here and beyond.  "
I love UML I am very fortunate to be at this school. I've had the chance to make meaningful connections with students and staff through Greek life. I came into this school and switched into Business and everything during that transition went better than my peers at other schools. I feel that I am learning life lessons as well as practical applications of the content. Also I feel that I am getting an amazing education for the price and experience being a member and leader in the multiple group projects and activities I get to be a part of. UML has been a place of growth for me and I recommend it to anyone looking for a quality education and a positive environment.
"My experience has been a bit rocky. There were some classes where I struggled and some I succeed in. The classes I struggled in were a bit difficult to understand mainly because the professor wasn't great with being hands on and showing examples. There was barely any practice problems of topics done in class, was expected and pressured to fully comprehend the information without an a review. I understand that some professor don't want to waste time however it helps to receive a review on some questions to help students. As they say practices make perfect. The classes I succeed in were manageable and the professor gave very good directions and examples of what to do. They were clear on their expectations and was very interactive with the class. This made the learning experience way better and easier to understand. "
Umass Lowell has been a life changing experience for me. I was faced with a hard decision my freshman year to transfer out of Providence College for monetary reasons and until this day I have not regretted it. I've met a lot of great friends and professors as well. I was able to dorm here and enjoy my experiences. The campus is also progressing with it's many renovations. 
"Freshman and sophomore years should definitely be spent living on campus or else it will be very difficult to meet new people and get that college lifestyle in. I love the campus and how it is divided into 3 parts, it makes the school feel much larger than it really is. Most of the professors I have had are great, but there are some terrible ones too When picking classes, use rate my professor and pick the best professors over the best class times. It might be inconvenient but it is totally worth it. Most of the buildings on campus have undergone major renovations over the past few years and are beautiful now. This school definitely has a lot of better facilites than other schools (besides Fox)."
"When it comes to education UMass Lowell is a top notch institution. Wether it's plastics engineering, nursing, or business they provide you with excellent staff and amazing facilities to provide students with a unique learning experience preparing them for the future. "
"I have enjoyed my time at UML. Many of the professors are very experienced in the fields they are teaching which allows them relay relevant information to students. Academic advising is a not perfect, as I was told by one advisor that I would not need to take an additional classes in summer of 2020, but later found out I actually was 4 credits behind. "
"I like being on the campus, especially in the library where I can get productive and creative."
I have loved my time at Umass Lowell. I have met so many amazing students and professors and have memories to last forever. The only negative side is the disappointing food and the limited options of certain classes when registering.
"Unfortunately I did not attend UMass Lowell this past fall semester, as I am a transfer student from Merrimack College. However, from the 7 weeks that I did spend at UMass Lowell, I enjoyed every one of them. I enjoyed learning in all of my respective classes, and the teaching styles by all of my professors were easy to follow. I thoroughly enjoy my core business classes and believe the information I am taught will benefit me following graduation. The campus layout and structure is easy to navigate and helps make learning an overall enjoyable experience. "
I was a good semester. 
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at UMASS Lowell. All of the professors are friendly. The classes are engaging. The campus is well set up so I can easily access all of my classes throughout the day. My only complaint would be the advising, but SiS is easy to navigate so I can usually do registration with very little assistance. "
"I love the size of campus because it?s a great balance between maintaining that close-together, the community feels while also having plenty of buildings. I am from out of state, so I was nervous coming in, but I immediately felt at home thanks to how welcoming everyone is. There is so much to do on and around campus. It's a good school that offers several majors, so if you decide to change your major you have plenty of options. However, academic advising isn?t very good because it is nearly impossible to meet with your advisor. There is a strong sense of community on campus. "
"This school has many different things to offer that I didn't even think of back when I was at a community college. This school has so many different majors that you have a vast choice selection. They have many different events as well to try to get as many student involved as possible which in my opinion is amazing and very fun. The size of the school at first may seem a bit overwhelming depending on where you come form. However when you get here, you'll end up loving it and be traveling from one campus to the next for classes, hang out with friends, events, or even just to study and hang around on campus."
My experience so far been really enjoyable. Not only am I a full time student but I am also an athlete. I play basketball here at UML and it's made my experience even better. I'm in the Manning school of busy and I'm really enjoying my major. I can't wait for the next 2 years.
"I have had a pretty good experience at UMASS so far. This has been my first year back to college in about 3 years so I am just excited to be back. I have been impressed in all of the programs and services the school has to offer, including both educational and recreational. Most of my teachers have been great, as well as the curriculum. The campus itself is also awesome and conveniently located. I love the sense of community amongst the students."
"I have had an amazing experience at UML. There is a lot of support and ways that UML makes this a friendly learning environment. Classes can be challenging, actively engaging all students, and can be a lot of fun too. There is a lot to do after classes end as well with extracurriculars, sports, clubs, and the rec center. Academic advising could use a bit of work as it is not as concise and helpful compared to other faculty like assistant deans etc. "
I thoroughly enjoy being at Umasslowell. The business school is incredibly helpful and always has the necessary resources available for me to succeed. There is always a new club or activity or event to try and that gives me a sense of never feeling bored. The different campuses are nice because they provide different environments for learning. The dining halls could be improved but that is really my only gripe with the school
"I have had a great experience so far at Lowell. I've had great experiences with advising and tutoring when I've needed it, and the school really made my transition to college as smooth as possible. Teachers are very flexible, especially playing a sport balancing everything is sometimes difficult, but everyone is supportive and understanding."
"I have had so many great experiences here at UML. There are so many ways to get involved in the community. There are clubs, events, greek life and much more. The classes are great and the teachers are kind and helpful. Would recommend this school to anyone."
"I love how inquisitive you can be at this university free of judgment. When it comes time for everyone to ask questions and be curious about the content at hand, it is met with awe because those hearing them understand and appreciate active minds. Being surrounded by people like this constantly pushes me to be more curious about what I have at hand and the world around me. "
"The school is wonderful, there are several majors to choose from here.  The campuses are different enough that there are different activities to do on each separate campus.  I have had great experiences with the advisors, and they have been knowledgeable to answer any and all questions I've had.  The professors genuinely care about their students, too.  The library has spaces to study in groups and spaces to study in silence."
"The classes are good.  The teachers are helpful and will work with you if you ask.  The advisors know what they are talking about and can answer all of your questions.  North campus has a lot of great restaurants nearby.  The library is great for studying alone or in a group.  I filled this out several times and I forget exactly what I said, so please forgive me."
"I have enjoyed my experience at UMass Lowell. These past few years I have taken a variety of on campus and online courses that will help me get the job I want. Professors here are helpful, understanding, and want you to succeed. There are several majors and concentrations to choose from so there is something for anyone who applies. The location is also convenient and easy to get around. "
"""It's a good school that offers several majors, so if you decide to change your major you have plenty of options. However, academic advising isn?t very good because it is nearly impossible to meet with your advisor. There is a strong sense of community on campus. We have excellent sports teams and games are always a lot of fun. Classes are challenging and rigorous."" "
"My goal was always to transfer to UML after completing my education at Middlesex and I was not left disappointed by the experience now that I'm in my senior year. There are many places to study and get work done which I appreciate. Unfortunately, the dining halls are lackluster, to say the least. They close way too early the food they serve is unfit for human consumption. The school tried many initiatives to fix it, but things always went back to normal after just a couple of months. Just fire Aramark and use UMass Dining."
"I have chosen UML four years ago thinking it will take one year and transfer to other schools, but I choose to stay because the quality of education and support is fantastic and the price is reasonable. I soon find out it is not important what school you went to if your goal is to build up professional skill, the importance is the professors and people you mate. UML has great professors and a decent environment. "
"Since I am a freshman my experience at Umass Lowell has been filled with new things, people, and situations but overall has been a great experience. One thing that was hard to adjust to was the location because I am an out-of-state student used to being in the city where it's easy to find things to do and get around with various transportation options. However, in Lowell, it's more in a town and it is harder to find things to do with limited transportation. But I have met a lot of new cool people including my roommates who are great. I have been to new events I have never thought I would be interested in like hockey, where you can really see the community on campus. Also, most of the professors really are great and want you to succeed and passionate about what they teach."
Umass Lowell is a school that has a lot of potential to be great. It does a lot of stuff well like offering great teachers and a good campus to learn on. It falls sort however in class offerings with some semester only one time slot for a class being offered. It also does not provide anywhere near adequate food options for on-campus students which has resulted in multiple student petitions and media interviews. If the school would be able to address these issues for future students it could offer a much better experience for them. 
"So far, I've had a great experience at Umass Lowell. I've met new people from different background and had the opportunity to learn more about their countries. Classes at Umass Lowell have also been very enlightening. The professors at school have tremendous knowledge when it comes to their field. I feel happy to be able to learn from them and be able to attend UML. I feel like many of the things I learn in school are things that I can apply to my life."
I've had a very stressful first year at the university but it has taught me a lot. I felt relieved that there are so many options of majors available because Ive already changed mine but overall Ive met a lot of new people and had a very good sense of community at uml.
I generally have enjoyed my time at UML.  As a transfer student it was hard to make friends and get involved for me but I've enjoyed the classwork.
I have loved my experience at UMass Lowell. It has helped me grown into a more mature individual. It has also given me the opportunity to gain my education while still exploring my youth and enjoying being young. Being on campus has given me insight on who I want to be when I want to be in the future and what I have to do to get there. 
"As much as I love UML, I wasn't able to afford it. I've had multiple problems with the Solution Center and they gave me a very difficult time trying to situate my financial aid problem. The problem I had must have been rare because the person working there didn't know what was wrong with my information either. I've had to go back to the Solution Center on multiple occasions and got into arguments because my mother wasn't there to be able to help me. Mind you, the Solution Center is only open Monday through Friday, which I'm sure you are well aware of, and my mother works during those days. As a mother supporting her family, and as the eldest child, I learned to handle every document on my own. I was 18 years old at the time; I should not have to call my mother to come all the way down to Lowell just to sign one document. It also didn't help that the Solution Center told me they revoked my entire financial aid in December right before I was supposed to register for classes, so that was fun. I love UML, and I wish I didn't have to leave, but without any financial aid as someone who supports all of her own finances, I just can't afford it anymore. The Solution Center was the biggest problem I had at UML. "
"I have had a great experience during my freshman year at uml, there are many campus events that you can attend and the recenter is great. The honors llc allow students to be in close proximity to other honors student and helps to build new friendships. I am a strong advocate for campus life because of the plethora of opportunities offer to the student and the ability to go see people for extra help. The campus staff is great and if you ever need help you can look to them. When you move back home you will surely miss living at school. "
I've had nothing but a great experience at UMass Lowell. I started as a civil engineering major then transferred into finance this past year. Everyone was very helpful in the transition to make sure I accomplished what I needed to. All of the staff at UMass is extremely nice and outgoing and are there to make you have a better experience. The campus is also full of great people to make new friends with. 
"So far my experience at the college has been good and I have learned a lot. The transition from high school to college was easy and all of the staff and professors have been nice and helpful. I'm a commuter and find the freshman lot for North campus to be somewhat inconvenient since you have to take a shuttle to get to North campus, and this can sometimes make me late to my first class if I'm in a rush. The library's are always a great place to get a lot of work done since it's easy to focus. The one major dislike about the school is that the campus' are separated since traveling back and forth to south and north for classes can be a pain. "
"It has overall been a good experience. The professors and staff are nice and helpful when you need it. The buildings in the campuses are all nice from what i've seen. The food is a bit overpriced, especially for the amount you get. My main dislike about the campus is the fact that they are separated so you have to take a bus to go from north to south for classes."
"My experience in this school has been a positive one. Advisors are readily available to answer my questions whenever I have one and the solution center is a great resource with anything. The availability to send in your questions via email make it even more convenient. Some of the things that could change is the cafeteria food. I feel like there has been a steady decline in the quality of food offered. Furthermore, the options make it very difficult to follow a healthy diet."
"Aside from the crazy spring semester my first year at umass lowell ive been introduced to a lot of new things. Living independently, new people, a whole new and exciting experience. I like the new classes that I am in and look forward to taking classes in the future that I really am interested in."
"I've had a good account at UMass Lowell. Everyone is friendly and the professors are helpful, flexible, and understanding. I've excelled at this university because of this and I am very grateful for it. "
"I am very pleased with the university. Everybody is super nice, the professors are very knowledgable and understanding of the students, and I have learned how to further succeed on my own and with the help of others. "
I like the campus. Everything is close together. The food could be improved a lot. Teachers are very helpful.
I've enjoyed my time here at Umass lowell. There's plenty of majors here and the programs are good no matter what you decide to get into. I love how the class sizes are reasonably small despite the fact the school holds so many students. The biggest strength Umass Lowell has to offer is their professors. They really do care for their students and what them to succeed. They're always willing to help you. I was very surprised because going into college I felt like most of the work you just had to learn and struggle by yourself.
"This school has given me the opportunity to experience a diverse community while also receiving a top of the line education. To top this off, The University of Massachusetts Lowell is an affordable school (relatively speaking) and offers students so much more than just a degree. The invested professors makes for a enjoyable and educating experience. I am so glad that I am a student at this university and I look forward to expanding my knowledge even more in my years to come here at as River Hawk."
"I have almost a ""love/hate"" relationship with UMass Lowell. On one hand I am thankful to be able to put myself through college and obtain an education- and on the other hand I have only had one professor who I really thought was extremely engaged and wanted to see the students learn. I think I'm waiting for that professor who I can look back on my college years and think, ""wow, they really made a difference."" I work full time to be able to put myself through college and there isn't really any help that is provided for student who do not qualify financial aid due to immigration status. However, I am very thankful for the school itself and the degree selection they offer is decent. "
UMass Lowell has been amazing the two years that I have been here. The classes have been challenging and rewarding. I have leanred so much about business and how to thrive in a professional environment. Being on a sports team has made academics a challenge for me but I would not trade it for anything
"I enjoy going to this school and find that almost all of my professors are committed to teaching and are very responsive. The community on campus makes the experience of attending class enjoyable, and I have had many experiences where I have learned something new that has made me want to explore a subject further. I think that this school has something to offer every student whether it be sports or in the arts. I feel like I am equally challenged and engaged in the classes that I take because of my professors and classmates, and I do not find it challenging to wake up early in the morning and commute to my earlier classes. "
"I am a transferred student for this year, and I really like the campus and school in general. I think there are a lot of things to improved on, but overall I believed that the university takes care of the students academically and in many other aspects that bring comfortability to its students."
"My experience here has been smooth sailing so far. The school offers a wide variety of majors so I'm able to see what I want. Also, the school has made the transition as a first-generation student comfortable. We have excellent places to study and there are clubs here for almost anyone. When taking classes, the professors really care about your success and will do anything in their power to make sure you're on the right track. "
"I have had a good experience at Umass, very wide area of studies. The academic portal has to be worked on because it is not user friendly and the solution center is not very helpful because most of the time you have to explain yourself from scratch every time you call. The diversity is a bonus and the helpful professors are also a plus."
I've had an adequate experience at the university.  I find some courses engaging and informative and most others tedious and impractical.  I've had ample opportunity for internship placements and resume workshops that I appreciate greatly.  
"I only have great things to say about UMass Lowell. I entered as a transfer student my sophomore year. All the resources available to students, especially transfer students, made the transition to a new university very smooth. The layout of the campus is scattered, but that is no issue for me considering I prefer city-like environments. From academics to the environment, I would give the campus a 4 star rating."
"After transferring to Umass Lowell from Umass Dartmouth, I had hard time adjusting to the new environment that was UML. I grew up in Lowell and know the ins and outs of it. one would think that my knowledge of Lowell would increase my experience, but it didn't. It took a while for me to find people who I could relate to and build new relationships with. In the end the school in which I thought was lackluster wasn't as bad as I thought it was. "
Am in love with the University in general.
