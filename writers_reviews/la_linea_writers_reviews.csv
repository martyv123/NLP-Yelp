"The video is engaging and encourages you to stay until the end in hopes of finding out what the point of the video is. In terms of quality, the simplistic idea is very effective. The concept is interesting considering there is an additional character that is handling everything, but he remains off-screen. Even though he is presented to be one of the main characters, he is still a minor role. Moreover, there are a couple issues in that the audio is unclear and seems to be in a different language which is slightly off-putting. Furthermore, the changing of colors from blue to green to purple, and at last red, is confusing as it hints that there is some significance, but in the way they are presented, there is no set pattern or distinction"
"It is a very good cartoon. I like the voices. I like the drawings. It is what it is, a cartoon. It wasn't meant to change the world. Just watch it. Enjoy it. That is the purpose. It is cute. It is well thought out. I liked it. It was cool."
"The impact of the message is lost in the use of the wierd gobbledegook verbiage.  I think it's an admittedly creative, interpretive approach to a simple message (cars are more trouble than they're worth, our need for speed is dangerous, bad for the engvironment, can put you in opposition to the law, and empty your pocketbook by incurring expensive tickets - a slow bicycle is the better transportation bet) but it is just too complicated (sophisticated) for the average intelligence of the human being. But maybe they're smarter in Europe (the prime target audience for consumption of this production.) Simlify it...bring it down to earth, would be my critique."
Just a simpl cartoon based on old time gags. This cartoon does nothing for the newer generation. Grand pa and his family would have been delited back in the day watching this. Today how ever it is a bore. Was it in French? maybe. The thought of police blowing a whistle at you is laughable and the most amusing thing in this cartoon.
"Cartoons are likely a form of entertainment that your students are very familiar with. As a matter of fact, every student in your class probably enjoys cartoons in some form. What they are likely unfamiliar with, however, is using cartoons in the classroom. Utilizing cartoons and comic strips in your classroom is a way to meet students where they are at and allow your goals to combine with their interests."
"The cartoon is amusing.  It has lines that merge into forms.  It is intended for adults as well as children.  There are many characteristics of the artist that lend themselves to an appreciation of this art work.  It may confuse some people, but they have to stick with it."
"I enjoyed the visual style with thick lines, but the ""dialogue"" and grating voice was extremely annoying.  / Pantomime with a narrator would have suited the character more as it would lend itself to actually having a coherent story."
"When the cartoon initially started, I thought I was going to dread watching it. Within seconds, I was wishing someone could just draw me a new car/boat/house, too. I liked that there seemed to be a hidden message in there. Although not your typical educational cartoon. it did remind you that there are laws to obey. I'm fascinated by how easy the creator made it look to draw certain objects. It looked to be as simple as drawing a line, but we all know it's significantly harder than that.  /  / Despite the fact that the cartoon was in a foreign language, I really had no problem following the story line. I could almost tell exactly what the characters were saying even though I couldn't translate the language. This is a cartoon that I think people of various ages could appreciate. Although, if there is a lot of swearing in that foreign language that I don't know about then it probably wouldn't be too appropriate for young children. Needless to say, I found it entertaining."
"The video is silly. It reminds me of childhood cartoons that aired on Saturdays. The little man is a bit demanding, complaining about having to go up a hill on a bike. When he gets a fast car to use instead, he finds nothing but problems beset him. This is the moral of the story, and perhaps life. With the hidden message, I think an adult can appreciate his experience. I found his conundrum familiar, as I've been there. The final scene is all-too amusing because it is so unexpected and sudden, like a punchline when it is least expected!"
"The cartoon is pretty funny and pretty creative. While I think its meant for younger kids, it does have a funny underlying message of being thankful for what you have. The figure in the cartoon gets drawn a bike then complains he cant get up the hill, so his creator draws him a car which ensues to give him nothing but problems. After the figure is fed up with the car the creator draws the bike again which he begrudgingly accepts. It was an interesting but simple little cartoon."
"Overall, I found this video amusing. The simple drawing style was amusing. Also, the occasional showing of the animator's hand was whimsical. I enjoyed the gibberish that they seemed to be speaking. I am not sure but I think it was intended to be Italian-like gibberish. I only speak a bit of Italian though so I can't be sure it wasn't just really fast Italian. I also found the ending to be unexpected and fun. Overall, this was good."
"I thought the cartoon was very good.  At first I thought, this is one of those, if you know what I mean.  However, once it really started I was drawn in and actually enjoyed it very much.  The only thing I didn't like was that it appeared to be in another language.  I would have preferred the language to be in English.  But overall, I thought of it as educational and enjoyable."
"It was a short funny little cartoon. I couldn't understand the language, but it was still amusing. The very simple graphics and animations didn't detract from the overall feel of it. I wouldn't say it's for kids though, it didn't have a children's cartoon feel to it. "
The video is very simple and a little bit boring. I don't like that kind of cartoons. I like more realistic and colorful cartoons. Maybe this cartoon was popular about 40 years ago.
"The video I watched is amusing, if a little offbeat. It is not like typical animations you might find everyday. I found myself feeling curious about what exactly the dialog meant, although you could infer the meaning, to some extent. It was definitely a fairly creative work, I think. Watching the piece definitely inspired a feeling of creativity and curiosity in me, as the video seemed to be older and foreign - these types of things made me think and wonder. I'd probably watch something else by the author, though I wouldn't seek it out explicitly. Some might find the audio a bit annoying, but I thought it was acceptable. I'd recommend this video to those who enjoy animation."
"This is a cartoon that seems to be for children. I did find it mildly amusing, but if you're older than the age of 5-10, you might not like it very much. One thing I did appreciate was that it told a story with very little. Simple lines, simple colors, simple characters. Despite that simplicity, it did get its message across. I found that to be pretty creative. I feel like some kids cartoons these days are too flashy and rely on gimmicks for amusement. This was just a couple characters doing their thing and if I were a kid I would have found it funny. It reminded me of some Pixar animated shorts. However, because it was in German, I could not understand what they were saying."
"The cartoon was very basic.  It was very loud and annoying, with an annoying character.  While he got what was coming to him, he seemed obnoxious.  It was overbearing and quite silly.  Not my cup of tea, but I can see where some people might enjoy the simplicity.  The incomprehensible jargon was annoying.  He seemed very angry and not very nice, so it was painful to watch him.  The color changes didn't seem meaningful, and it was kind of weird. The policeman was the best thing about it, and even then he seemed silly and not good at his job. /  / Overall I wouldn't watch this again.  Nor would I go out of my way to find more about this cartoon.  I wouldn't bother watching this."
Colorful. Great. Fast. Interesting. Smart. Hip. Short. Off-putting. But Nice.
"The cartoon was funny and entertaining. Now I'm not completely praising it, those feelings are mild. It's worth a watch if you enjoy cartoons in general, but I don't think I would really wanna go out of my way to watch it again. The animation style was pretty neat though. I found the characters constant yelling to be mildly annoying though.I felt the cartoon could have been just a bit more silent. Other than that I kinda liked it. But only a little."
"The cartoon may have been aimed at an audience that is more accustomed to esoteric art than we are here in America. The short film seems to be made in Germany and in my eyes parodied the French. The artist seems to have been going the route of making the characters speak gibberish instead of an actual language which would indicate an appeal toward small children - yet young children would be unable to identify with the scenes that were presented here. The situations that the poor doodle were put through seemed just a bit mean. One could interpret this as the hand of a cruel God dealing harsh karma out to someone who becomes increasingly incensed by the frustrating situations that he finds himself in. It could also be a statement on the ever watchful state of authority and how confining it is. This cartoon really didn't connect well with me, but I am unsure if anyone would have found it particularly witty or original."
"I love the cartoon. It is funny, engaging, and keeps your attention. The comedic aspects of the cartoon was a delight. I can see showing this cartoon to my niece and see her laughing to it. Yes, the cartoon is in a foreign language. But the action on the screen can be universally understood. So, I don't see any problems with people not getting 'it' because the dialog is spoken in non-English. Overall, I approve of this cartoon."
"I would have to agree with the above review of the cartoon. The cartoon was engaging for a while. But it also got old and since you don't really know what they are saying it hard to get a grasp on what is going on. I look the drawings and the voices were funny though. I would stick with one color for the cartoon and I would make the language one that we can understand. Also I am not sure but I would guess that this cartoon is European, thus and American would not appreciate it as much. "
"I really liked the cartoon because it was in gibberish. I liked that feature because it reminded me of other cartoons that are like that. However,  the point was hard to follow and then when you figure it out that is not very funny. The main thing that kept me watching was the little dude.I liked how he interacted. I also liked that he interacted with the artist. That also was a feature of some other cartoons I have seen so that was nice. I think the drawing was overall very good."
This is a fun cartoon for children to watch. A fair amount of humor for adults as well. It is in a very unique style that will make it fun to watch. The characters in the cartoon don't speak in any real language so anyone can enjoy it. The main characters are the figure and the artist who draws him. This introduces a funny dynamic between the artist and his creation. It does a good job of showing how a work of art can come alive and at the same time change a lot. This cartoon will make children think about what they are seeing due to the unique style. There are a lot of twists and turns in the cartoon. The action is slow at first but there is enough to keep the audience captivated until the end. 
"This cartoon is a short piece about a line drawing man who is given (by way of the artist's hand appearing onscreen) a bike, then a car. The man is happy with both vehicles at first, but keeps running into things about the vehicles that frustrate him. If I had to guess, I'd say that the theme of the cartoon has something to do with people's tendency to be happy with something for a brief moment before finding fault with it. While there is no dialogue per se (all words are spoken in gibberish), the meaning behind what's being said is always understandable. The man is hassled at every turn by a police man, who gives him tickets for going too fast in his car and then parking where it's not allowed. As the obstacles keep coming out of nowhere, it is easy to feel the man's frustration, but you can't help but feel that the man should be a little more adaptable. All in all, it's a fairly interesting little movie that communicates its idea quickly and well."
"The video works with its own simplicity and engages the watcher through its minimalism.  This minimalism coaxes the watcher into a deep concentration and focus that ensures the cartoon is properly digested and analyzed.  What the viewer will find is a story that conveys, through color and emotion, a story that is just as engaging as one that is propelled by dialog.  Despite the gibberish being spoken, the watcher is more focused on the feel of the story dictated by the characters and their physical actions relative to the world in which they find themselves.  The colors of the scenes shift as the tone of the story shifts, and these subtle cues inform the viewer without direct acknowledgement, but those cues nonetheless ensure that the viewer is on the same page as the characters as well.  Overall, I find this to be a great story, with humor and emotion, conveyed through somewhat abstract and minimal means, but resonant nonetheless"
"There was literally no point to the video. Over-analyzing and looking for meaning in the film is pointless: it's merely a distraction for children and something for younger viewers to amuse themselves with. The video is clearly meant for Italian audiences as the audio is in Italian, albeit it is also mixed with an assortment of gibberish. The video was not at all engaging and the audio was irritating. Want to listen to high pitched nonsense all day? I suspect listening to a child of 4 or 5 would be much more amusing. The video's ""story"" is lackluster. If I wanted to watch someone speeding and getting in thumbing his nose at the law, I probably wouldn't watch a cartoon of it. There is so much more that could have been done with this that it's disappointing that the animator chose the route that he did."
"I suppose I would start with it being strange that this reviewer would consider it a problem with the audio that the cartoon was in another language. It didn't bother me at all and in fact added a bit to the enjoyment because it caused me to focus more on the visual and story-based elements that were going on. I do agree that the color changes did have some significance in how the transitions and motifs were being played out. We both agree that it was a simple and amusing cartoon. Of course more could be drawn from the idea but I don't think that necessary at this point. It did amuse me especially that even though the artist offered the man a bike once again, instead of it playing out in a more typical American 'happy ending,' he ended up falling through a hole in the earth. Not so happy."
"The video was an endless roller coaster of figuring out what was going on. First you have the drawn character and the character which is a hand in the cartoon. The hand seems to be all powerful as he erases and creates new things at the flick of the wrist. The drawn character speaks in either gibberish or a language I'm unfamiliar with, but in a way it was better than if it was in english and we had finite answers for what was being said. The omnipotent hand creates objects like said before for the drawn character. Which causes the character to have a strange journey and what seems like a wild ride of pain and suffering and comic relief from this magical hand god. For what the cartoon is compared to your normal garden variety cartoon it was a breath of fresh air and quite enjoyable."
"The cartoon was amusing in the fact that it kept my attention to the end. I wasn't sure what the point of it was and I wanted to see how it would all turn out. I still don't think it was meant to teach me anything, but rather just meant to laugh. The cartoon drawing seems to be extremely impatient and rude. He demands things by yelling and getting upset and that ultimately gets him what he wants. It reminds me of most peoples general demeanor in that they want everything without having to work or wait for it. There were changing colors, but I don't know if they have any significance. The point of view was also from an unknown human drawing the scenes as we watched."
"The video was fun right off the bat.  You hear a tune that will get stuck in your head, it is still stuck in mine.  From the beginning you wonder if this guy is actually going to speak english or not.  You soon find out that you do not.  Watching this angry little drawing guy speak gibberish was actually pretty funny.  I enjoyed following along with him as he got into his little troubled events.  Even though he was not speaking english it was like I could understand what he was saying.  The different colors used in the video made everything look nice and polished.  I certainly had a good laugh watching it.  While it is not a video I would normally watch on my own, or even recommend, I still enjoyed having the opportunity to watch it.   "
"I found the cartoon to be very amusing at times, and slightly less so at others. I really enjoyed how the cartoon character was complaining to the illustrator until the illustrator changed what he wanted in it. I think that the language being unclear was not at all a disservice to the cartoon. I think that it made me pay more attention to the actions that were on the screen. Overall, I really enjoyed the cartoon and would be happy to watch more of it in the future. I can only imagine what the illustrator may do next. With a cartoon like this there really is no limitations on it."
"This video is silly and amusing.  The drawing style is simple- just white lines.  The simplistic nature of the animation keeps you focused on the ""story.""  It also leaves a lot to imagination if you choose, moreso specific details that aren't there.  The character is also talking to it's creator.  That concept is pretty unique so it makes this cartoon more original.  It is a fast paced cartoon so it keeps even those with poor attention spans focused.  The events in the story also provide comic relief."
"This cartoon was mildly entertaining. It appears to be more suitable for the younger generations/toddlers.  The cartoon features a rather simple design concept which focuses on using one continuous line to create the figures.The cartoon does have a few flaws as well. The cartoon language is Spanish, which might affect those who speak different languages in their understanding of the cartoon plot. The cartoon changes background colors as well, which is somewhat off putting as there doesn't appear to be a reason why. Overall, this is a good, fun, amusing cartoon for Spanish speaking children."
"The video was engaging yet very silly. I found the main cartoon character's voice aggravating and because of that I would not willingly watch another one with same character and/or voice. It was engaging enough that I waited for a point at the end and thought I understood it to some degree. However, by the end of the cartoon, it was clear to me that the video was mainly for entertaining children. Despite the cartoon characters speaking in a foreign language, the point of the video was clear. I would definitely let my 8-year-old son watch it, and I think he would find it very entertaining because of how silly it is. The background color was slightly distracting, yet at the same time it added to the video. It seemed to have more orange and red colors when the main character was frustrated or angry, and purple tones when the character was amused or mocking, and blue or green when the the character was pleased or mollified.  "
"I've seen a number of similar cartoons. Simplistic line cartoons with audio in a language that I don't understand. I think the theory is that the squeeky voice of the characters will work no matter if you understand the language or not. In this case it didn't work for me. Actually it never does. So, I was left to wonder, would this cartoon be funnier with no audio? Or is it only funny if you understand the language? Or is it only funny if you do not understand that language? I don't know the answer to all those questions, but I know that I didn't enjoy this one any more than all the other cartoons of this style that I have watched. It doesn't do it for me. ymmv."
"I really liked this cartoon. I liked that it was in a different language because it forced you to be engaged with the characters to figure out what was going on. I liked the characters voice, even thought I could understand him, his style of talking made me laugh. The illustrations were simple but clever. I wanted to see what was going to happen next with every scene. The only unnecessary thing was the changing back ground color, it was distracting. Overall  would like to watch more of these cartoons. My children would especially enjoy them."
I enjoyed the cartoon. In the begining I was concerned about not understanding the lanuagage but found out it was not intended to be understood. The cartoon had a fairly clear message about driving the speed limit. The final sign was unclear. I assume it was a no parking sign. Only because the main character received a ticket. I still don't understand why in the begining the character got on the bike. This cartoon is drawn more to a younger crowd. It could be a bit more detailed as to it's intent. / 
"The cartoon was basically gibberish.   The artist interacting with his cartoons was very much like an old Bugs Bunny gag.  The audio for the cartoon was heavily reminiscent of Elmo.  All in all these qualities gave the cartoon a feeling of ""been there, done that"".  It was interesting to see the line become animated, but there are much better animations to enjoy.  In this world of endless media no one should waste time on this.   If there was a point to it's creation then that point alludes me."
"This cartoon is fun to watch and the main character is quite enjoyable.Though you can not understand what he is saying you still can perceive what he is trying to say. The cartoon itself is drawn in a very simple way, but that does not take away from the overall quality. The cartoon seems to be conveying a message about speeding and safety I believe. There is a person drawing the cartoon as it goes along but this person never speaks or reveals themselves.. Overall this was a fun and amusing cartoon to watch. a little bit silly but fun nonetheless."
"I enjoyed the cartoon a lot. I thought the idea was fairly original. The main character was engaging and effectively communicated his personality.  This is especially impressive because the gibberish the character spoke did not allow him to express himself through words. It's true, though, that his voice contributed much to the character through intonation. I found the running joke involving the policeman was also funny. The overall message of the cartoon was simple but effective as well. Namely, that asking for more and more only brought the main character more trouble. If he had stayed with the bicycle he was originally provided, things would have been much easier for him. Overall, my impression of the cartoon is highly favorable."
This video at first I wasnt sure I would like.  After the first couple of seconds I could feel myself smiling.  This cartoon reminded me of something I used to watch as a kid.  I felt myself going back to watching that other cartoon and remembering it fondly.  This cartoon kept it light hearted and fun.  The main character was witty and funny.  He kept my attention well.  I would love to watch something like this again. It being me back to my childhood
The video was simple but entertaining. It was narrated in an unfamiliar language. I felt this technique was interesting and creative.  The viewer is left to use their imagination to fill in the conversation themselves. The storyline was easy to understand even without narration.  There were twists in the plot that kept the viewer interested.  The premise that there is a character drawing this world made it seem like anything could happen at any moment.
"The video, while simplistic in nature, is very engaging. The humor really keeps your involved through the video. You want to see what the main character will do next. His grumbling are amusing actually very life like. You can see the real human emotion and reaction in such a simple drawing. The little things, like the wind up key on the police officer, really add the the narrative. These show things like how the officer is robotic, only doing what he is told. Whereas the main character is constantly trying to change his world. He requests the narrator multiple times to do things that he would like done."
"At first the cartoon seemed a bit uninteresting but shortly after it started it began to catch my attention. The longer I watched the cartoon the more interested I became, the more amusing the cartoon became. I think the cartoon was simple but creative, sometimes it harder to take something that simple and make it entertaining but the creator of this cartoon managed to accomplish just that. The main character of the cartoon was engaging and interesting and I liked the it ended. "
The video was highly entertaining and and fun to view. I couldn't understand the language being used but that doesn't matter! The art style is simple but it conveys a lot of emotion and humor in an easy to understand universal way. The audio is simple but once again it totally conveys what the artist is trying to get across. While there may be some deep hidden meaning that I am not understanding...at face value this cartoon is interesting and humorous and that is a great thing. Overall I would highly suggest this cartoon to anyone looking for an interesting view for a few minutes. At under 3 minutes you have no reason not to check it out!
The cartoon was very simple. The concepts were presented in a very simple manner. The cartoon seemed to  portray the frustration of being bound by limitations. These limitations might be our own physical abilities. They might be the rules of society. The character always wanted to challenge these limitations. However he was always reigned back. An interesting point was made. However I wouldn't call it particularly entertaining.
"This cartoon was amusing and, although child like, was geared more towards adults. It's humor was slightly sophisticated and would be over the heads of children. The cartoon's main character has all his actions and predicaments governed over by the cartoonist, who helps him out of a few scrapes by the judicious erasing of a policeman. The language, which seemed to be either Italian or French, added to the European flavor of the cartoon. The screen seems to change colors according to the carton man's moods. For instance, towards the end of the cartoon the screen turns red, which seems to reflect the cartoon man's irate mood. His calmer, happier moods are reflected in blues. All in all the cartoon is amusing and I would like to see other videos of this genre to see if the little cartoon man has more scrapes his cartoonist friends gets him out of! "
"THE CARTOON WAS PRETTY INTERESTING. I LIKED HOW ONE SCENE LED INTO ANOTHER AND HOW THE ARTIST HAD TO DRAW/ADD ON MORE LINES/DESIGN IN ORDER TO CREATE A DIFFERENT SCENARIO. ABOUT THE ONLY THING I DID NOT CARE FOR WAS THE VOICE/NOISE OF THE CHARACTER. IT WAS SLIGHTLY ON THE ANNOYING SIDE. OTHERWISE, I REALLY LIKED IT."
"The video is amusing the first time you watch it.  I would imagine that further viewings would cause it to lose a bit of its appeal.  It's easy to see that it's a bit dated and would be considered something classic from the area it was created in.  As the spoken language is not in English it requires that you use only what you can see and the ambient sounds to identify what is happening.  The story line is entertaining enough to stay until the end to determine what happens to this person that is trying to get somewhere.  The video quality and audio is quite dated but doesn't detract from the overall enjoyment of seeing it.  It would appear that there is some sort of over arching educational tone about being happy with what you have, but it is not made completely clear, and in the end the poor guy falls off the page which is somewhat confusing."
It was very interesting video and have a good point of life. Even it was in different languish it's easy to understand of what they trying to say. Its people never appreciate what they have. We should be thankful for what we have. And if we got blast to get something bigger it our life we should know how to use that. And don't take advantage of it.
"I really could not pick out any endearing qualities about this cartoon.  It was not entertaining.  In fact I found it to be overall boring and not at all funny.  Maybe children would enjoy the simplicity of the cartoon, and it could have worked in certain scenarios, but this just did not work.  I could not wait for the cartoon to end.  It didn't make sense, it wasn't funny, and it just didn't work.  I enjoyed the overall concept of the off screen cartoonist who controls the world but the characters in the cartoon were not well done.  The main character was unsympathetic and I actually enjoyed when he got pulled over by the police.  I would not recommend this cartoon to anyone."
The cartoon is amusing and keeps you watching until the end. The characters are speaking a foreign language which you don't necessarily need to understand to get the point of the cartoon. The music in the background adds to the cartoon as being amusing. The background color changes throughout the cartoon that tells us of the character's mood. There is a character whose hand we see that is in control of the drawn character. The drawn character seems silly and expresses certain real human emotions while the hand is god-like. The way it's drawn is very simple but that adds to the simplicity of watching it. It's easier to get the point across when it's visually simple.
"I found this cartoon both relevant and endearing.  This poor character experiences much the same types of problems in his everyday life that we do.  He's met at every turn with authority which makes him change his way of doing things.  His freedom is restricted.  I liked the way the characters talked.  Although the words were indistinguishable (much in the way the Minions talk), it was obvious what was taking place.  The drawings are simplistic in the whole, but they effectively tell the story the artist intended to tell.  The changes in color were effective in setting different moods based on the actions going on on-screen.  I loved it!"
"The cartoon has a simplistic art direction which helps add to it's charm.  The background color changes and helps add to the atmosphere in a way that lets you feel the main characters emotions better.  The artist of the cartoon plays a role in the video and ends up feeling like a main protagonist without taking away from the ""star"".  Even though there is no distinguishable dialog, instead opting for a form of gibberish, you are clearly able to follow the tone of what is being said. The introduction of the police officer feels a bit forced but ultimately serves to enhance the story of the cartoon.  If there was a single complaint it would be the ending.  I was anticipating something a little more clever to end this cartoon.  But ultimately it is a simple ending which does serve to emphasize the simplistic nature shown throughout.  If you are looking for some quick simple fun I would highly recommend spending a few minutes with this cartoon."
"The video was amusing. At first, I was put off by the simple design. But as the cartoon continued, I warmed up to it. I liked the idea of the artist as another character of the cartoon. The language issue wasn't a problem, I understood was was going on, even if I couldn't understand the language. I would be interested in seeing other similar cartoons in the future. It was of high quality and produced well. The ending seemed appropriate and made me laugh. Overall, it was an enjoyable cartoon and it brightened my day. "
This cartoon is fun. It is quite a bit different from the ones you see now and days. Even though you could not understand what the cartoon was saying it was extremely interesting. It kept me watching to the end. It moved quickly from one thing to the other. It was very appropriate which is refreshing. The video is short so it is easy to watch. The colors are basic. It made me laugh at times. It also made me smile at times. I would recommend watching this cute clip.
The cartoon held my interest throughout its entirety. I was amused at the way that the character used a language that was not intelligible yet you could understand the thoughts and feelings it aroused. The use of colors lent me to experience feelings that coincided with the emotions such as red for anger or fury and blue for a sense of calmness. The poor character had a very bad temper and seemed to be going through some bad luck in his attempts for using the modes of transportation he was provided. His communication with the artist and then the policeman showed various types of emotions. I liked the irony of the ending and it gave me the feeling that one must be grateful for what we have because it may be lost.
"The cartoon offers a new premise to which I had never seen before.  The cartoon features animated characters, including our main character and a fellow police cop, but it also features an additional character whose identity is unknown.  All the audience sees of this additional character is their hand, and they draw on the screen.  Whatever they draw on the screen becomes a part of the animated characters' world; for example, the offscreen character draws a bicycle and a car for the main animated character to use, and the offscreen character is able to change the speed limit on the street signs.  While then I was fascinated by the originality of this cartoon, I also had a few issues with it as well.  The cartoon is in a language that I am unfamiliar with and does not have any subtitles or closed captions.  While it's not difficult to follow along with the story without knowing the language, I was still annoyed that I did not understand the dialogue; I would have loved to have been able to follow the storyline completely!  Furthermore, the main animated character is always yelling, and I found myself to be uncomfortable with all the noise.  Perhaps if I had known what he was saying then I would not have been so annoyed - maybe he was yelling for a good reason.  I enjoyed the idea of the cartoon then and would love to see more types of these cartoons, but I would probably only seek them out if I understood the language or if closed captions or subtitles were offered as well."
"The cartoon represents a character who encounters different situations.  The character is approached by another character who writes him/her up for what he/she has done.  The character seems frustrated. The character cannot get away with anything.  It is amusing at times because the character thinks he/she can get away with doing things.  It is interesting that it starts out with the character using a bicycle and ends with the character going back to using the bicycle. Even though the dialogue is in another language, one can understand what is happening. The ending is appropriate!"
The  video is interesting even though you can not tell what is being said. There is enough context drawn into the cartoon for the viewer to be able to effectively assume the tentative plot. It was an amusing watch as the main character progressed through the 2D world that was constructed for him. The colors of the environment and background seemed to change and coordinate with the perceived mood and emotion of the main character.
"This was a cute little cartoon.  It was very simple lines drawn on a colored screen, but I think that added to the appeal. It was also in a different language, so that might be considered off-putting to some.  However I enjoyed it because it was obvious what was going on and the language sounded adorable.  I also thought it was cute that the main character kept telling the artist to change things for him.  The music in the background was cute as well, I still have it in my head.  It was interesting enough to keep my attention, and short enough so I couldn't get distracted.  I think little kids would really enjoy this.  "
"I actually remember seeing this cartoon as a kid. It was a mini-movie kind of thing that was shown during some other show, of which I have no recollection. The animation is incredibly simplistic, but effective. The speaking of a different language was convenient, considering that most American kids would never know what the character is saying, so it could theoretically say any damn thing it wants and get away with it. The background would occasionally change color, and I felt that reflected moments when the character got really angry - the more red-ish the background was, the more angry it implied the character was."
"The video is both fun and interesting to watch. I loved the alternative language, which reminded me of the teachers from a Peanuts cartoon. Though it wasn't clear what was being said, I felt the artist did a brilliant job having the characters express their emotions. I loved the different vehicles, and I felt there was a message here about speed. I mean, speed, as in we are all trying to get from point A to point B, but no matter how fast we go such as 60 MPH or 130 MPH, it's never fast enough. I enjoyed the police officer stopping the progress, showing in a way that patience is a virtue, and perhaps expressing a hint that stopping to smell the roses isn't always a bad thing. It was fun seeing the main character get angry, annoyed, and such as he was delayed by a slow moving vehicle before seeing his delight as he was granted a fancy sports car, which further emphasized his desire to get moving faster and faster, only to have his progress impeded by traffic signs and a traffic officer with a handy whistle. I might be reading into this, but that's how I interpreted the animated cartoon, and I thoroughly enjoyed both the content and the message.  "
"The video started out being kind of confusing, considering I don't speak the language that was being spoken. However, it wasn't long before I realized that I didn't need to understand what was being said to figure out what was going on in the video. Based just on the tone of the speaking by the characters, you could tell what was going on. I found the video to be funny and interesting. It was very simple yet kept you engaged enough to want to finish the video to see what was going to happen. I think just about anyone would find this video worth the watch and the person who made it did a very good job with it."
"This cartoon is very special to me because it reminds me of my childhood. Although I cannot remember where I have seen it, it is very familiar to me and I feel like it may have been featured on The Electric Company or Sesame Street. Regardless, it is quite different from most cartoons you see today. It is simple, but quite effective because you really want to see what happens to the main character. I like the hand effect, as the person drawing becomes a character too! I think it is a great cartoon for children, and it can teach them about ideas like controlling frustration and being polite. The language appears to be a fictional language, which means that it would appeal to kids from many different cultures. Overall, I think this cartoon is interesting, unique and engaging."
The video was funny. Even though it was not in my language you could still follow the story line. The character showed different feelings in the video depending on what was happening. The tone of the way he said his words made it easy to follow the mood of the story. The character talking to the writer which was original. I loved the simplicity of the pictures. You didn't have to worry about details so you could just enjoy the humor instead. I would love to see a series of these types of comic videos.
This video captures you attention with it's simplicity. There are a few different parts that tell a story. As you watch all the way to the end and think about the video as a whole you get the whole story. Some of the words and language is hard to understand but just the visual images you can catch the story. The simple line design really made it easy to follow. With little background it allowed you to stay focused on the main story being told.
"The cartoon is a funny and intelligent look at aggressive driving habits. The video is funny because the character's response is over the top yet highly familiar to anyone who's gotten a driving ticket. The style of the video is very minimalistic yet the clear lines, narration and ""dialogue"" tell a very clear story. The audio is a little unclear but I think its a deliberate garbled mess of Italian. It isnt important exactly what the characters are saying, because the context and emotion displayed tell the viewer everything they need to know. The changing colors are a clear indication of the driver's frustration ( red at the very end to indicate he was really mad ). /  / In the very end, the driver is presented with a bike once again. I don't know whether this signifies anything important but to see him fall of the line is amusing. Overall, this is a funny video that shows good story-telling is separate from its presentation."
"I found the cartoon quite amusing and it kept my attention throughout. The cartoon also sparked my interest. Although the language was not understandable to me personally, I was nevertheless able to interpret the basic meaning of the plot. The actions of the characters were enhanced by the changing color of the background throughout the sequence. This color change revealed the emotions of the characters during the actions portrayed. The cartoon was specific and detailed in that it examined several varying actions and outcomes. It was humorous and creative. This video, although somewhat subjective, presented somewhat clear advantages and disadvantages of engaging in various behaviors. It was impressive in that is promoted somewhat good behavior regardless of the response of the main character. I found this cartoon entertaining and somewhat thought provoking. "
I have no idea what this video is about but i found it interesting. The voices are funny and i could not stop laughing. I main character look like he was facing obstacles and getting angry all the time. I was kept glue to the video. I could not wait what would happen next. I wonder what language was the video was in. It looked like Italian or something similar. The animation looked old and simple. Somebody was bored and made this. Overall i enjoy watching this video.
"The cartoon was somewhat unique. I haven't seen anything like it before. It was in a different language so I had no idea what was actually being said, but it didn't seem to matter. There is a main character being constantly redrawn on what appears to be the cartoonists sketch pad. The main character goes through a range of emotions as he goes through a day in his life. Some of these moments are funny and the characters actions make the emotions obvious without having to understand the audio. The act of the constant redrawing the cartoonists hand visible in the process gives this cartoon a unique feel. I would recommend this to others. "
"The cartoon was mildly amusing. It seemed to showcase the trouble that one gets into for being overly demanding and self-interested. The cartoon man regularly demands more and more and is never satisfied. The cartoon ultimately shows us the consequences of such a personality. In terms of presentation, the cartoon was simple and kind of quaint. I can't say the quality is good, but it fit the overall message. The audio, even if it was in a language I could understand, was off-putting. The voices were reminiscent of hamsters or some other chirpy animal. It was a creative way to portray the message, but the quality overall was low. "
"I thought the cartoon was engaging and amusing.  I would chuckle every time the main character stuck his tongue out at things he didn't like.  Even though it was presented in a language that I didn't understand, German I believe, I could still understand what was happening most of the time.  The cartoon characters' body language was very distinct and the changing colors behind the characters helped to convey their messages even better.  The voice inferences of the characters also gave clues to their emotional states.  The cartoon was engaging in that I kept wanting to see what would happen.  Would the main character drive too fast and get arrested, have a terrible crash, run over the policeman???  I didn't expect for him to get so upset and angry that the artist would have to take away his car and give him his bike back!  The ending was cute because the main character seemed to be O.K., even relieved, to get back on his happy little bike and ride off.  I think the simplicity of the entire cartoon was charming.  It kept me focused on the message of the cartoon and I therefore wasn't distracted by all the background ""noise"" that we find in so much of our video messages today. "
"The video is amusing and creative. The interaction between the off-screen artist and main character who requests things of the artist pulls you in. Even though the cartoon is a simple line drawing and the character speaks in an unfamiliar language, the story is clear. The use of richly colored background emphasizes the emotion of the main character. The background music is upbeat and helps enrich the story. "
"I found the cartoon entertaining. It was unclear, to some degree, as to its significance. I thought it was trying to sell something but realized that was not the case. The characters interacted well, but I would have liked to have understood the language exchange. The concept was unique with the changing of transportation and the ending was totally unexpected. It was funny lead into a driver's training class for teens. It showed the speeding and disrespect to officials which could be used in the class. Overall it was a good cartoon with an unexpected ending. The changing of colors added to the drama of the story."
I didn't like the character using another language but I did enjoy watching the cartoon. Some of the audio was difficult to understand. The cartoon is different and interesting.
"The cartoon was very funny. Although the characters spoke a nonsense language it did not matter. The idea was a simplistic one just a few scribbled lines. This however made the story all the more effective. The viewer is captivated by the character, wondering what will happen next.The concept was unique. It was very cleverly executed. I like the fact that anyone from any country ,no matter what language they spoke, would understand this simple yet very creative story."
"The cartoon video was very entertaining. The concept, wherein an off-screen illustrator draws the cartoon as it happens, is very creative. Despite conversing in a language different from my own, I could understand what was happening in the cartoon. It appears that the background colors were changing to illustrate the main character's feelings which also aided in understanding the cartoon's context. I laughed out loud a few times when watching this cartoon. I was very engaged in the cartoon and how it would end. Watching the main character's reaction to the bicycle again at the end of the cartoon after all of the encounters he had in the car with the police officer was entertaining. I would definitely watch more of these cartoons despite not understanding the dialogue."
"This cartoon takes a very simplistic and easy to draw idea and turns it into a very amusing cartoon. Although there isn't anything elaborate about the cartoon it somehow draws you in and makes you want to stay until the end. It is not in English, or rather the language of the cartoon is just mumbled and jumbled words of some sort, but this adds to the charm of it. Instead of verbal cues, the observer must respond to and watch the tone and background color pattern of the cartoon to assess changes. For instance, when the main character is happy the background turns green, but angry it turns red. The content itself is rather welcoming in a sense that many people would have experienced similar frustration at some point in their life as the main character does. The quality of the artwork is minimalistic, but effective. Overall, it is a very enjoyable piece of art and could be shared with the whole family with each member perhaps getting something different out of it. "
"Not really sure of the purpose of the cartoon.  Although it was funny and entertaining. I'm not sure of the point it was trying to make. the last part of the cartoon was a little confusing to me with the sign having no speed limit on it.  Since the cartoon was in a different language, it made it even more difficult to understand. I agree with another review that the color changes had a significance, but i'm not sure what that was. The quality of the video was good.  the main character made me giggle with it's reactions to what was happening with him.  the graphics were simple but effective in what the character was trying to display."
"While I couldn't understand the language, the substance of the cartoon was easily understandable.The quality of the video was simple as were the drawings and style used by the artist.  Going deeper, the concept of the video was presented in a way that the language barrier didn't take away from what was trying to be established. The characters, from the main role to the supporting roles, all congealed in a satisfying manner from the beginning to the end. However, there were some confusing parts the cartoon that may have been effected by the language barrier. One particular aspect were the changing colors during certain events in the video. I couldn't tell if the if the colors had some sort of pattern that was trying to explain something to the viewer or were just random changes that had no meaning to the message in the video. That tiny compliant doesn't hurt the cartoon overall though. It still was able to get it ideas across to the viewer in a meaningful matter.  "
"The quality of the recording is low and it hints to technology a couple of decades old. The characters were amusing and the concept of the commuter dealing with a traffic officer is a classic. I liked the use of the ""breaking the fourth wall"" trope. The artist's hand can be seen drawing props for his main character. The language sounded like Italian but the inflection was enough to convey the feelings of each scene. The two-dimensional stage was effective for telling this simple story. The background colors seemed to change to reflect the mood of the main character, red for anger etc. Overall, it was a pleasant story and a good way to spend a couple of minutes. "
"The cartoon is engaging and does encourage the audience to stay tuned to the end for the finale. While the changing colors on the main screen are slightly confusing and the language (which seems to be unknown, with no subtitles) provides a barrier, the main intent of the video is pretty basic and clear. It's amusing and provides entertainment to the audience. Providing a second character is in keeping with the theme and seems to engage the main character even more. This second character adds to the main character's personality. All in all, an amusing short animated video that keeps the audience entertained and intrigued to the end."
The cartoon is definitely an original. Once I started watching I had to keep watching to find out what it was about. I was imagining in my head what they were say. It brings out your creative side while you're coming up with a dialogue in your head. using very simple lines and one color the picture is quiet clear. A very neat concept. I haven't seen any cartoons in a while so this was refreshing. The artist was very complex yet very simple with this. Well done!
"I found the video very amusing and entertaining. This is something I would never watch, but glad that I had. It's very simple in in how it was made and leaves you wanting to know whats going to happen. Although it was in another language it wasn't very hard to understand visually what was going on. It does present some form of educational value, but nothing I believe children would get much out of. I would definitely would like to watch more of these in the future if I came across it on YouTube. However, I probably wouldn't seek it out on my own."
"It was a funny cartoon. I think it was intended for children based off the humor of it. But, I still found it to be quite amusing. I'm not sure what language it was in, but I think it was French. It seemed like an old cartoon made in the 80's or something. While it was amusing, I wouldn't want to watch it again as it wasn't THAT great. The animation style was unique. I had not seen a cartoon like that before. Overall, it was an OK cartoon. Wouldn't recommend it to people my age."
"THE CARTOON WAS VERY GREAT IS REALLY FUN AND ENYOYABLE, THA CHANGE OF COLORS LIKE ME A LOT BECAUSE REPRESENTS THE FELLINGS OF THE PRINCIPAL CARECCTER WHEN HE TRAVELS AROUND THE EPISODE WITH THE BICICLE OF THE CAR, IT IS WAS VERY CREATIVE A LEARNS VEY SIMPLE THE MANNERS WHAT WE NEED THE DO IT THE LIFE WHEN WE TAKE ANY WAY, THE DIALOGUE IS MAKE TO EVERYBODY UNDESTAND BECAUSE THEY TALK STRONG OR WEAK DEPENDS OF THE CASE, I WAN TO SEE MORE CARTTON WITH MY KID A LAUGHT A LOT SEEN THE MOVIE "
"This cartoon was a very amusing diversion. The use of (breaking) the fourth wall, including the 'animator' in some bits was very creative. Also, the interactions between the primary character and the animator was fun. The primary character seemed to have some trouble with authority, and got into some trouble over it. Overall, very enjoyable."
I enjoyed the simplicity of this cartoon.  There was nothing fancy about it but I think that fact brings some charm to it.  It reminded me of some cartoons that I used to watch as a child.  The plot was not exactly clear but I enjoyed watching it to the end to see what would happen and what the reveal at the end would be.  I thought that the humor was easy to get and was appropriate for all ages. I think that this cartoon concept is very adaptable and could be put into many other situations and still have an impact.  The only thing that bothered me a little bit was that the background color changed occasionally.  I would have preferred that it stayed blue the entire time as it was quite distracting when it changed. 
"It's a brief cartoon based around the old trope of the animated character interacting with the animator.  It's not particularly clever or original.  Really, the most favorable description I could provide for it would be, 'cute.' /  / By all means, watch it if you're interested.  It's less than three minutes long??the cost of entry is low.  Just don't set your expectations terribly high.  I'd suggest, however, that if the animator-interacts-with-creation concept appeals to you, your time might be better spent watching Duck Amuck."
"It's difficult to determine if this cartoon is intended as a simple amusement on the order of a Warner Brothers production, where a hapless character gets into continual distress much to the amusement of the audience, or if there's something more at work here. The cartoonist plays the role of a God of sorts, offering the demanding, perpetually harried protagonist what he wants--but always with a catch. Here it is speed, status, technological progress, by which the protagonist is continually hamstrung by unexpected obstacles, rules and bureaucracy. Eventually, we think, the protagonist will be satisfied with the simple and reliable--but that isn't the twist that the God-cartoonist gives us. /  / The polyglot European 'dialogue' is somewhat irritating, and the simplistic style and jazz backing is very much a product of the age it was created, which gives it little audiovisual appeal. But it does, I think, at least provide some food for thought, and that's all we can ask out of art."
"It's difficult to follow this cartoon. Being in a foreign language is a distraction. There are, however, several things in it which translate well. The drawing of bikes and cars, for example, anyone can understand. Also the arrival of the police officer is understandable and amusing. I didn't understand the language, unfortunately, so probably missed some funny jokes. I also didn't understand the shift in colors that occurred throughout the cartoon. Aside from these small complaints, I thought the animation amusing and would possibly watch other editions in the future."
"This cartoon is edgy and imaginative. It gives the viewer a comical look into the minds of human beings. We demand all kinds of things from the ""creator"" who some of us call God. We act very childishly, in this regard. First, we project that there is some power doing good to you and bad to me. Then we ask for this or that, and interestingly, we are never satisfied with what we ask for. We always want something different. Yet at every stage, we ask for what we believe will make us happy. Then we discover some issue, problem or unfulfilled desire. What a comedy! The creator of this cartoon encourages us to recognize our own nonsense and laugh at it. Brilliantly written and executed, the message is clear. We are all like two-year-olds who don't know what to ask for in life. We don't really know what will make us happy. Even without intelligable words, the cartoonist makes his message quite clear. Funny and philosophical. Highly recommend!! Five out of five."
i found this video in interesting. it held my attention
"I enjoyed the cartoon very much it was had a quick pace and the music was cute. / the main character was interesting even though i did not understand the words his feelings and intent were well displayed.he seemed to get into trouble with the law even when the situation was changed by the animator. the character seemed to to go from being content to being frustrated , by indulging in his desires to go faster. the length of the cartoon was just about right, holding my interest through it's entirety. "
"The cartoon was horrible. Really it wasn't a cartoon, it looked like it was drawn on a chalk board. The characters were speaking gibberish, so i had no idea what they were saying. There was also no storyline. Basically this cartoon was just a waste of time. A useless piece of crap that i wish i never watched. I also have no idea why i had to watch it. I don't know why someone would waste their time creating that."
"I thought the video was hilarious, I laughed the whole way through. There's a ""4th Wall"" human character I'll call The Artist who controls the happenings in the cartoon, changing certain details to suit the needs and whims of the main cartoon character. He starts out with a simple outlined person, who immediately demands that the ""ground"" before him be extended. The cartoon character starts walking, finds his path barred, and The Artist turns the obstacle into a bike. At first the cartoon man is pleased, but when he encounters a steep hill, he is angered, and the background changes color to reflect his mood. The Artist creates a car, and again the carton man is pleased (and the background changes), zipping over the hill, only to be confronted by a speed limit sign, which he laughs at and ignores. But then he is stopped repeatedly by a cartoon cop for increasingly unpredictable offenses (despite demanding interference from The Artist), and he grows more and more agitated (signified by the changing background colors), until finally The Artist wipes away the car and gives the cartoon man back his bicycle. The cartoon man climbs on and starts pedaling again, muttering imprecations all the way... and then rides off the end of the ""ground,"" presumably in ode to Shell Silverstein's ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"". ;) I laughed the whole way through!"
"The cartoon was definitely interesting.  The voice acting detracts from the cartoon, as the voice is very annoying and grating.  Especially so, if you do not understand the language they are speaking.  It sounds like high pitch gibberish.  The storyline was easy to follow despite the language barrier.  The simplistic art style with the hand and pen appearing was creative, but otherwise forgettable.  If you're a kid who understands that language, it's probably a cute story that you won't remember.  But for everyone else, it's a forgettable cartoon that is borderline annoying.  I wouldn't recommend it to my friends and I don't plan on watching it again."
"This amusing video seems to illustrate a case of ""be careful what you wish for."" A funnly little character is introduced at the beginning and he -- or she -- remains a constant throughout the short film. The character speaks in jibberish but this does not diminish the viewer's ability to figure out the point of the story. The video begins with the character demanding an improved mode of transportation.The transportation demands are met when an anonymous character draws a bike or a car and then each of which magically materializes as a functioning transport. First, a bike is given to the character but he is dissatisfied with this travel system because it requires to much effort to travel uphill. Next, the character is given an automobile and rips off down the road after being fueled. The character is stopped by a law officer and presumably ticketed for speeding. Predictably, the character repeats his negative behavior, even trying to cheat the system by changing the posted speed limit to a ridiculously high number. After the third or fourth traffic violation and resulting ticket, it would appear the character finally concedes that the car had been more trouble than good and returns back to the bicycle originally drawn for him. Overall, a funny video that's definitely worth viewing."
This is a very intriguing cartoon. I think if you start thinking about the main point or idea of the cartoon you get into one of the characteristics of humans. I think it is greed. I noticed he is complaining a lot and always wants or needs something. When all along he just need the person who drew him. 
"I found the cartoon to be charming and witty. I felt the ""drawer"" of the cartoon to be a ""Godlike"" creator and handles life situations of the drawn cartoon to his will. I felt like the meaning of the video (at least what I gathered from it) was an impression of how God works in humans lives. He will provide, but he will also let free will do what it wants to and has us lead the lives ourselves, only intervening every so often. Is that the point of the video? Am I reading too much into it? I have no idea. I enjoyed it, I thought it was funny and clever. A nice way of saying ""Be happy with what you were given in the beginning."" type things."
"The cartoon was kind of off-putting. It was hard to engage with the main character as he seemed to be complaining a lot to the person who was drawing him. The sequence of events were straight-forward and it didn't interest me to keep watching. The art style was okay and a bit creative in it's own right. I just couldn't get over the annoying voices. Although you are kind of able to understand what's happening, it's frustrating and bothersome to the ears. Very unpleasant and I can't even be sure who the cartoon is designed for. I wouldn't recommend it to children."
"great video. very much got my attention. some ""lessons"" to be learned but done in a humor way. Liked the non english audio probably was not planned but add to it. I like the drawing and the change in background showing emotions. "
"The cartoon was simple yet creative! It used simple lines and only one color at at time to tell an interesting story. /  / The music was cute, and the characters only spoke in unintelligible sounds, but you could still understand what was going on in the story - which was interesting. "
"This video was okay to watch.  It reminded me of a cartoon series that I was shown in grade school.  It's a silly video that shows imagination with drawing and playing with ideas.  The language wasn't in English, but you could tell by the gestures and inflection of the character what he wanted and what was going on.  I think this is more geared toward young children.  It's amusing and shows imagination.  Which is something young children enjoy.  For me, it just made me feel a little nostalgia because I watched something like it in school."
"As far as cartoons go, this one was pretty uninteresting and boring. / It was barely a cartoon. It was more of a crudely drawn stick-man animation / The language spoke in the cartoon was a bunch on gibberish and you were left with just your imagination of what was being said. / The background changes colors which holds some meaning on whats happening with the character but you never truly know what it implies. / The cartoon character is also actively trying to break the law which could be misinterpreted by children as a fun thing to do.  /  "
"The cartoon was a bit confusing. The drawing sequence, however, is pretty creative. I did not understand too much of what was going on though. I am sure the culture that watches this cartoon finds it interesting. I, however, did not like it. It did seem pretty creative though. "
"The cartoon was not really entertaining. It was basically the same skit over and over again. He would do something wrong, the cop would show up and repeat. Also the cartoon was in a different language so that made it a little harder to be interested. I would have appreciated if it was in English. The only entertaining part was the second person staying off camera but affecting the outcome of each situation. Also the cop popping out of the trunk of the car was a nice touch. Overall I think It could have used some work to enhance the overall quality. "
"The cartoon was a little entertaining and the voices of the people made it humorous. The actual content of the cartoon seemed to drag on a little throughout and the only thing that really kept my attention on the cartoon was how comical the voices of the people were in it. There was a small story that developed in the cartoon that was simple and easy to follow even without understanding what was being said by the characters. The colors and animation made the cartoon aesthetically pleasing to watch because there was change in colors and the cartoon flowed well. I watched to find the purpose of the video and am still confused as to what that was. The story could have used a little more clarity as to the purpose and meaning of the video. I am still unsure as to why this video would be shown. There is not really a super strong educational purpose and it was not funny enough to just be for entertainment. I feel that to make this video better there should be a more clear direction of the purpose of the video. Overall, the quality of the video was creative and done well however, to make this video more appealing there needs to be more purpose in the story and individuals. By adding more story it would be more clear about the purpose and intent of the video.  "
"I thought the cartoon seemed very pointless. The main ""Character"" had no depth and nothing to inspire wanting to know more about what would happen next. The art and design was very simple and plain. No speech was actually used (that I could tell), it was all in gibberish. The same thing seemed to happen repeatedly throughout the short cartoon. I think the animator made the character's life easier whenever the character demanded it. I just didn't get drawn into the cartoon, and couldn't wait for it to end. Overall, it was a basic and uninteresting short cartoon."
"The cartoon is very typically German. The main character's lack of content (he is only an outline, a form) is consistent with German depictions of daily life. His life revolves primarily around wanting to have an efficient mode of transportation (a sports car) and being able to drive it fast. Driving it too fast at first brings down the power of authority, of the police, but the character is able to appeal to the cartoonist and have the speed limit raised. He zooms away gleefully. Of course, the character is not actually German at all- he is speaking some gibberish language that sounds like a mix of Italian and Hungarian. He is too silly, too cartoonish to be a German himself.  The cartoonist has instead pushed his identity off on the hapless neighbors to the south. "
"The video starts out interesting, a play on a work in progress, with the cartoonist being able to interact with the cartoon character on the storyboard. This is fun and innovative for the first few interactions from the cartoonist. Then, it all goes downhill fast. What happens is that the cartoon character is always disgruntled about his situation. The cartoonist steps in to try to assuage him, but fails most of the time. It's one corny failure after another. It gets tiring fast."
"I found the cartoon very annoying. I would rather have a root canal. The audio was very irritating and I just wanted to turn the volume down but didn't. The drawings are very amateur. I thought the plot of the cartoon was boring. The main character was unsympathetic. It made me feel stressed out, like I was being tortured. I can't imagine how anyone would want to watch this. The three minutes dragged on for eternity. I couldn't wait for it to be over. "
"Overall the cartoon is amusing. Although I could not understand the dialogue in the cartoon, I think the attitude of the main character is still relatable. I think most people can relate to someone who changes moods very quickly and can be demanding. The style of the cartoon is very simple but it is also creative. The storyline is amusing. However the ending is a little open. It is not clear what the overall point of the cartoon is. It is hard to get an accurate viewpoint on the cartoon without understanding the dialogue. "
"To be completely honest, I found the cartoon to be one of the most annoying things I have ever experienced. I do not know if the characters were speaking a language or if it was just gibberish. Either way it was too fast. The cartoon was very simple which is something I actually appreciate. I would have enjoyed it more if the characters weren't so downright obnoxious. I could not wait for the cartoon to end. I am sure I am not the only one who could not stand it. I am really hoping I do not have to sit through that again!"
"This cartoon was very amusing. It was amusing from the start to the end. It was interesting to see the person in this cartoon face so many problems. I believe that maybe that could be the message of this cartoon, to not give up whenever you keep on running into problems. The language used made it even better. Even though I didn't know what he was saying, I could still understand! The artwork was very simple and nice to look at. Overall, this was a great cartoon."
"This cartoon seemed to be about going the speed limit when driving. It had several indicators of this by the attention that was taken to show the speed on the signs multiple times. The character switches from a bike to a car to go over a hill. After that he is stopped by some kind of policeman and gets in trouble for going to fast. Although it's not in English I did get the sense that the main character was kind of a dick. It seemed not to care about the speed limit or what it was doing wrong in general. The cartoon did use the background color to indicate the mood of the main character. It switched from peaceful blue when things were going well and red when the guy got mad. By the end of the cartoon, we see a sign that just says no driving in general. At this point our main character was just fed up with the speed limits and just got back on his bike. I assume these are a series of cartoons, in French maybe, that teach random lessons to kids about following rules."
"The only negative thing that I have to say about this cartoon is the fact that I was unable to understand what was being said. I am not certain as to whether or not this is because it was in another language or because it was in a made up language, in which case would make it part of its humor. With that being said, everything else about this particular cartoon was amusing and fascinating to me. I very much liked the dynamic between the character that we never see (the one who has control over the chalk-like drawings) and the main character. There is a completely easy to follow feel that you get when watching this cartoon and I believe that can be accredited to the minimalistic look and feel that the creators of the video have provided. Overall, I would definitely watch more of this kind of cartoon and would highly recommend watching this particular cartoon to others. "
The cartoon is about a man being drawn. He is wandering around town. He eventually drives a car. A Person is drawing him and he finds it amusing . He walks around town. He seems like a wanderer. He the main character of the story. The story is only about him. I'm not sure how I'm supposed to write 8 sentences on a 2 minute video. 
"The video is very engaging and makes you feel as if you are watching a story unfold. The storyline tells a story about how you should be happy with what you are given in the first place and not complain about everything, simply enjoy the life you have. The story unfolds as the character isn't happy with his bicycle so he's given a car, then hes not happy with the speed limits, so he gets speeding tickets, then once he's finally happy and has his bicycle again he falls off the roadway. It's a very interesting story which relates heavily to life. The artist took an interesting approach by ""editing"" the character and his surroundings ""live"". It made the story feel very engaging and kept you interested by wanting to see how it unfolded. "
"I found the cartoon interesting. I think because the languange was in Italian?, that made it more interesting. The waving ofthe hands and talking fast, what I envision an irate Italian to act. The cartoon itself, the subject matter..I think it was about emotions. Happiness, impatience andanger. The changing of the colors represented this."
"This cartoon is in a minimalist style that is enjoyable. There are various background colors that match the mood of what is happening in the cartoon. The animation breaks the ""fourth wall,"" so to speak, as we can see the hand of the illustrator as he/she adds certain elements to the frame or erases certain things. The voice-over that is used is quite amusing. The character has a ""flappy"" and high-pitched sounding voice that sounds like a Sesame Street character that is red and likes to be tickled. The actual content of the cartoon is simplistic but entertaining. This character tries to progress beyond certain obstacles and is constantly stopped. At the end, he/she bikes off of the end of the page. In a minimalist fashion fitting to the cartoon as a whole, ""ENDE"" pops up on the screen. This is an enjoyable cartoon that is short enough that anyone can sit down to watch it. "
"The cartoon uses the conceit that the artist interacts with his created drawings.  The artist draws a ""stick figure"" like fellow and gives him a couple of vehicles to operate.  The main character has various run-ins with a police officer that are played for humorous effect.  The language seemed to be Italian which actually made the action more amusing as Italian speakers  always seem to be more animated (no pun intended) than English speakers.  I wouldn't say that there was much of a plot, but I didn't expect one from something that was less than three minutes long."
Overall I really enjoyed the cartoon. The simplicity of the scenes added to my enjoyment. The off screen  artist was a great touch of realism to the cartoon. Not being able to understand what was being spoken add to the humor. The tone of the speech and the mannerisms of the characters left a lot up to interpretation. Being allowed to fill in the blanks with my own conceptions of what was being said was fun. Colors changing in the background added to the impressions. I would watch more cartoons made in a series of the same concept and characters.  
"The cartoon is very artistic and starts off with a simply drawn person. He sometimes interacts with the artist and demands certain changes. I'm not sure if I'm supposed to understand what he is saying, but I wanted to know more. First the character gets a bicycle, but complains after he can't go up a hill. The artist draws him a car and he drives over the hill but then gets in trouble with I suppose a police officer. The use of colors was interesting, but I was getting a little tired of the main character complaining all the time. In the end, he ended up going back to the bicycle and falling off the path. I'm going to assume that the message of the cartoon was that sometimes simple is better. I would be open to seeing more of this kind of animation again. However, I would like more information about the story before watching."
"Cartoon was simplistic and easy to follow.  Although there was some mild humor the video overall was not very amusing. The video felt like it dragged on to to the simple jokes. It felt like there might be an overall point or punchline to the whole thing, but in the end there was not. It is not something I would seek out again. I would not recommend the cartoon to others. It was just overall, uninteresting."
The cartoon was interesting that it was not spoken in English but you could tell what was going on. The main character did not like riding a bike so he was given a car to drive. The character did not like to follow rules and was busted by an authority figure. It appeared as if he did not like to follow rules even after being scolded multiple times. I like the fact that the character got what he deserved by not following the rules. It was entertaining to see the interaction between him and the authority figure. I like that he got his car taken away and was given a bike to ride again . He then fell off the line and that was a great ending. I liked the video overall. 
"I loved the cartoon.I don't feel it's necessary to analyze it and look for some deeper meaning, or to find fault with anything that may seem to someone to not have a purpose or direction to it. I see it as pure enjoyment. I love the way the artist draws the character a bike, and then a car, and then a bike again. The idea of the entire cartoon being drawn with so simplistic lines is wonderful. And, the language, or rather lack thereof, is wonderful. The tone of voice and body language says it all. It's great. I loved it because it was just plain fun. And, I wrote it down before I came to this page. I want to see it again, and similar ones if they're on youtube with that one. I'm going t recommend them to a friend. "
"The cartoon was certainly creative, although very simple. The style was interesting, where the character has contact with the artist and has some sort of dialogue back and forth. The character therefore can somewhat change his surroundings by talking to the artist. I found the beginning to be pretty interesting, but about half way I stopped caring. I found the voices of the characters to be very obnoxious and annoying. At parts I didn't quite understand what was going on, there just was a lot of arguing between the characters. The color changes of the background I found was pretty cool, because it seemed to change color based on what the character was feeling. It turned a bright red when he was angry. Overall it was an alright cartoon. Not terribly interesting but easy to watch and enjoyable in some parts.  "
"I feel that the video is very educational, showing that you should listen to traffic signs, and officers of the law. I find it creative in that it uses line drawings to bring the characters to life. I also find that the entertainment of watching something unrealistic, the line drawings, do real life actions speeding, and disobeying officers interesting. However I do find that the colors of the background changing should signal some significant change, that does not happen. And There are not patterns to the colors changing and the colors staying the same."
"The video was very annoying because the voice of the character distracted from the narrative.  Although I found it interesting how the character started on a bike, went to a car and back to the bike again.  It was difficult to engage in this video because it seemed chaotic. "
"This was an interesting little cartoon.  It held my interest to the end and watching it I wanted to find out how it was going to end.  I found it amusing to watch the different things the main character was going to do and what obstacles he was going to face next.  Certain things made this unique like it is in a foreign language and their is a off screen drawing ""overseer"", who basically can change the scenes to add or take away from the obstacles that the main character faces.  I though overall it was fairly humorous."
"The video is interesting and simple but lacks content that keeps you motivated to keep on watching. It is very repetitive and does not hold your attention. The plot is very predictable until the end where it ends up making no sense. I think that the amount of time taken to portray their plot could have been shorter. In all, even though the video was slightly amusing, I feel as though it was time wasted. I think it was all stretched out and could have been compacted into shorter clip. I also think there could have been more variety to the plot."
"The video is well made and interesting. The character is a line drawn by the omnipresent hand that is usually off screen, but directing the forward action. The intent of the video is somewhat hard to understand because the language is not English and so it is hard to follow. Over all the video was entertaining, you want to keep watching just to see what happens next, but since I have seen it and don't quite understand the purpose, I don't have any desire to watch it over. "
The video was hard to get into at first. Once I got into it I wanted to see what would happen next. The style of the cartoon was very simplistic so it wouldn't be for everyone. Having said that I think it fits the cartoon well. The plot was simplistic and a bit hard to follow. It was a little harder to understand since the dialog wasn't in English. I feel that the use of only a few colors suits the cartoon well. Overall the cartoon was engaging and worth watching.
"This cartoon was amusing and somewhat reflective of life.  The character was slightly obnoxious and boisterous, but still somehow lovable.  We followed him through various encounters with a police officer as he drove a car and broke laws, until he lost his license.  The changing color backgrounds reflected the characters emotions.  I found the cartoon enjoyable and could relate to the character.  I would recommend it to anyone."
"This cartoon looks to be from the 60s or 70s and may be in Italian, or may be in gibberish. There is a character who is made of a single line who is walking along a road. He expresses what seems to be dissatisfaction with his surroundings so the artist's hand appears and draws a hill. The cartoon guy doesn't like that and so the hand provides a bike. The bike is still not satisfactory to the cartoon man and so the artist draws a sportscar. This causes problems with another cartoon character, a traffic cop. This is where it gets really amusing. I especially liked the part where the cop popped out of the driver's trunk to issue a citation! In the end the artist provides a solution that works for everyone. I don't know without more context if there is supposed to be a lesson, but I was glad to see that there was a YouTube link so at least I can figure out more about the cartoon when this survey is over. I agree with the other reviewer that the changing colors of the background would seem to be of symbolic significance but as they didn't seem to follow a pattern it was hard to tell. However, maybe it is just an amusing cartoon to take at face value. It was a pleasant way to spend three minutes or so."
"The cartoon begins with pencil/chalk drawings and it is a little unclear of its purpose. There are no audio clues as it is not in English or any discernible language but emotions are conveyed through the characters' tone of speech. The person draws a bicycle which is replaced by a car and subsequent interactions with a police officer are entertaining. I feel children may enjoy this film, as it has some basic physical comedy one would expect from a children's cartoon without interpretable audio. Overall, the cartoon is mildly amusing but does not seem to have much of a point. I would recommend it to those wanting a brief break from the day. "
The video is simple yet still engaging. I am not exactly sure what the video was trying to show or teach but I did enjoy it's simplistic approach. The color changes were nice and I like how it was obvious that the lines were meant to be like someone was drawing it as it went along. The language was definitely strange and I couldn't even pinpoint what language it was. Maybe french? I liked the ending where it showed the name of the creator in the line
The cartoon seemed to be pretty amusing. I thought that the characters did their general purpose. The animation was of decent quality. I really didn't understand the main purpose of the characters. The audio wasn't clear. It was pretty entertaining to watch albeit short. I think it was more directed to be educational more than anything. But it did provide a bit of humor. Cool clip.
"This cartoon breaks the fourth wall, which I always enjoy in any show.It reminds me of a Looney Tunes cartoon where Daffy Duck was being drawn by the cartoonist and put into interesting predicaments.  In this cartoon a hand draws a crudely drawn line character, who then wants to go somewhere. The hand draws the character a bicycle, but the bicycle doesn't make it up a hill. The hand then draws a car, which the characters drives. After being pulled over for speeding, and going into an area with a slow speed limit, the hand changes the speed limit. At the end the hand erases the car, draws the bicycle again, and the character rides the bike off the line and falls down as if off a cliff. I thought the hand drawing the characters was very clever and I like the crudeness of the drawings. The color background changing was very strange and of course the language was impossible to understand. But I really liked the language - the lack of comprehension actually made me enjoy it more. "
"This cartoon was amusing. The line character was easily upset. The hand changing the surrounding of the line character was quick to appear when the character got upset. some of the characters had wind up key type things on their back. The main character did not, i wondered about that discrepancy. the background color seemed to change with the mood of the main character. It was easy to decipher the main characters mood from the tone and speed of his speech even though the language was unknown to me. It was fun to watch to see what scene was going to come next. However that said I don't feel the need to watch it multiple times."
"I thought this cartoon was extremely boring.  I didn't find it was engaging at all.  There was nothing in it to keep my attention.  The high pitched voices of the characters was annoying.  It made the character sound really whiny.  There may have been an ultimate point, but it didn't make me care enough to keep concentrated to find out.  All I could think about was how much time was left.  Would not watch again."
"The cartoon is in a foreign language which greatly distracts from qqits value. It is somewhat clear to understand what is going on in the cartoon but the foreign language used is distracting and silence would be preferable. The graphics are plain and line drawn and simplistic.  It is very unclear what the point of the story is. The main char actor seems to get several tickets for speeding then runs out of gas?  I fail to see the point.  This is not a cartoon I would like to see again let alone recommend to anyone else to watch. Possibly if the cartoon was made in english, hearing the dialog would allow me to understand the point and possibly find humor in it.  As it stands I give it a 3/10 rating."
the cartoon was fun and engaging. The sound was a little off and i could not tell if it was just gibberish or the a different language altogether. You could tell it was an older cartoon but it was creative.
"I thoroughly enjoyed the cartoon.  It keeps the view engaged from beginning to end.  The simplistic style  sort of lets you use your imagination as it moves along.  The fast paced dialect and seemingly foreign language helps in inviting the viewer to be a part of the story. It is just about the right length.  The ending is surprising and funny.  The use of the artist himself as part of the story is what makes it work so well.  The background colors change, to indicate the changing mood of the character and scenes.  All in all, it is a simply funny short animation.  Watch it.  You'll like it."
"The cartoon was amusing but confusing due to it being in a foreign language. While the animation tends to be simple line drawings, these add to the story and include the animator in the story. The main character in the animation is an ambiguous person and one who tends to be cranky when he doesn't like the story line. This adds to the story and increases the novelty of the animation. The main purpose of the film is unclear. It is not obvious as to whether this is simply a cartoon or if it is supposed to deliver a message. Travel and the consequences of the mode of transportation seem to be one of the main points of the story. The main character begins his motorized journey on a bike but can't pedal up the hill so he complains until the animator gives him a car. He then runs into various troubles due to the car before returning to traveling by bike. The moral of the story could be about being careful what you wish for but this remains to be determined since the language in unintelligible to me. "
THE CARTOON WAS SOMETHING THAT KEPT MY ATTENTION . I WAS WAITING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS NEXT. IT WAS FUNNY. IT WAS EASY TO UNDERSTAND. THE GIBBERISH WAS A LITTLE CONFUSING BUT ALL IN ALL A GOOD QUALITY VIDEO. THE COLORS WERE BRIGHT AND SEEMED TO CHANGE FROM TIME TO TIME. I WOULD SAY IT CAN BE VIEWED BY ALL AGES.
"I didn't think the video was very engaging. I thought it was too outlandish and not very educational or unique. It seemed like something that would be on the Cartoon Network, but at a time not watched by many people. I didn't really understand the concept of what they were doing in the cartoon or why we couldn't understand the weird language they were speaking in. It seemed foolish and I wouldn't want my kids to watch it. The educational value was lacking. I didn't learn anything from it. I think the colors would keep very young toddlers amused but not kids old enough to reason. They wouldn't understand what was going on - because I'm an adult and I didn't."
"I found this video held my attention very well.  At times it was confusing, trying to figure out which way it would go.  The quality of the video is pretty good, however like most things, it could have been better.  I liked the way the story went.  This is definitely a video I would watch again, to see if I notice things about it that were not substantial in the first viewing.  I like how everything seemed so simple and yet informative."
The cartoon was entertaining and amusing. The main character resembled most people in his attitude for easier and flashy transportation. I liked the color change of the screen. It helped to show the emotions of the character. The interaction with the illustrator was interesting. It was like the voice of reason. It reminded me of a teenager and a parent relationship. It drew me in because I have the relationship at home. It seemed to be from a parent's point of view. I did notice how the language was probably foreign but not really a big deal because it was not understandable anyway. 
"I really enjoyed watching the video. It was a fun video. I didn't quite get what message it was conveying but overall it was entertaining. The language was also a barrier in enjoying is fully. It would have been much better had it been in English. The main character seemed to be in control of the situation, however, he wasn't free either. I didn't get what was going on in the video. I didn't quite get who the video was intended for either."
This cartoon is done in a very simple style to try to engage the viewer. It's an odd twist that the animator is done in a way where it's almost like he's a supporting character to the cartoon character. The simple style done this way can draw in both kids and adults being curious as to what the point of the cartoon actually is. But there are also aspects of it that don't make sense. Such as the cartoon being in a different language make it very difficult to really understand exactly what is going on. It makes it very difficult to really pick up on the relationship between the character and animator and what the story that is trying to be told is. It appears to be some type of moral story about following rules but it is difficult to tell. Also there are color changes in the cartoon which signify something but it's hard to know what. All in all it is an engaging cartoon but it has some flaws that could be improved.
The cartoon was very interesting. I especially enjoyed the concept. The animation was very good. I had not seen something like that done before. The characters within the cartoon were quite amusing. It did appear that the cartoon was not in English but that did not make a difference in how I viewed it. I most love the simplicity of the animation and the characters. It was short and straight to the point. It was quite appealing. 
This video is in a different language.  THis video is short.  This video is dumb and pointless.  The people have giant noses.  The audio hurts my ears.  I can't understand anything.  It just seems pointless to me.  I feel dumber for having been forced to watch it.  Thanks for nothing.
"The video is confusing from the start because it is in a different language. The intent of the video is not clear. It is also uncertain if the cartoon character has a valid reason for being so grumpy and demanding. There are obstacles for him to get what he wants. He is able to get assistance from the cartoonist, but it is again not clear how helpful this is. Trading in the bike for a car is helpful, but what is up with the different speed limits? Also, what is the purpose of the police officer? How did he get in the trunk? It is amusing in some ways, but it is confusing in others. It would be good to know the context somehow."
"The cartoon if you can call it that is about as appealing as having a needle driven into your ear repeatedly while being slapped in the face with a wet towel. The plot is nonsensical; the ""dialogue"" is completely annoying and the characters make very little sense. If you're a user of amphetamines you might find amusement in this video, but for the rest of civilized society, there is very little in terms of substance to be found here. At first glance, you might find the initial concept of the video interesting, but you will soon find out that it goes nowhere fast, and you're stuck wondering why you're even sitting here wasting your time on this video. I would have a hard time recommending it to a child let alone a grown adult. The picture and audio quality are quite poor as well. The creator of this video seems amateurish at best Overall, I believe it's fair to give this video 2 stars -- and even then I believe that it's getting far more than it actually deserves."
"The cartoon had an interesting concept and art style that drew me in. It was a simple idea, but I found it quite creative. It was easy to follow the plot even though there was no discernible language. I thought the idea of an omnipotent character off screen controlling the action was quite creative. I would definitely recommend watching the cartoon, though it doesn't have a deeper message that is clear. I'm also not sure what the target audience is. It's not clearly for children."
"It was an interesting video.  The voice was a little annoying though.  I was very engaged in it tho because of how it was created.  The line aspect was fun.  It was quite humorous as well when he laughed at the 60 mph speed limit I also chuckled.  The colors where nice and easy on the eyes.  The artist having his hand in the screen was also pretty cool as it looked like a live cartoon.  I enjoyed watching the cartoon, but the fact that his voice was the way it sounded really turned me off to the volume.  I do not think that the audio was necessary to understand that point of the cartoon.  The artist did a good job getting his point across."
"I found the cartoon somewhat confusing. I could not make out the language that was spoken. But from the actions, it appeared to be a a very angry person. He likes to break the law and hates when he gets caught. I do not understand the color changing in the background. I do not understand the cop person and what he is actually doing. He appears to write a ticket but then never gives it to the other character. And I really do not understand the way it ends. All and all it was confusing and not interesting to me."
"This video is quite clever and entertaining.  Some reviewers seem to have trouble with the colors changing.  However, I noticed the colors seemed to reflect the mood of the main character.  I believe the cartoon is also in Italian.  I don't think that distracted me too much as it was much more of a visual experience.  I enjoyed the short style it was presented in.  I could watch many videos like this back to back.  It was simple, yet enjoyable."
"The cartoon was a bit confusing but very entertaining. The characters, while cartoons, had a unique art-style to them. While I couldn't understand what was being said, I could follow the general plot pretty well. I found the main character rather silly and selfish, but did not enjoy watching what happened to him in the end. However, overall, the little clip was quite funny and cute. The flashing colors and drawn out figures proved to be interesting. Each character also had his own personality, which I could see being difficult to do in such a short cartoon. The creator obviously put a significant amount of time and effort in to this. "
"I found the video very entertaining and animated. There was a lot of activity depicted by the cartoonist. I liked the fact that the images sprang from a line on the ground, and every aspect of the cartoon revolved around the line. I thought it was interesting that the language spoken by the characters could not be clearly understood. It sounded like a little like Italian. The presentation was quite funny and engaging. "
"I enjoyed the cartoon, despite its inability to describe precisely what the end goal was. At first I assumed it was aimed for adults, but as time went on it seemed as though it would be more interesting for a child. My first impression, however, was that it is foreign. In my experience, I have never really enjoyed foreign cartoons. Despite this, I gave it a shot and found it was pretty interesting. I believe the length of the video may have kept my interest, because if it was any longer I would have probably closed out of it and moved on. One thing I certainly enjoyed about it was the simplistic nature of the drawing. It was easy to understand and anyone, despite the language barrier, would be able to understand it. The colors were also an interesting touch, but I could not detect their relevance. The funniest thing about this cartoon was the way the cop was constantly knowing what was going on, and kept writing the man tickets. "
"I do not understand this cartoon.  I do not like the cartoon. First, the language is gibberish so I cannot understand anything that is being said.  Also, the cartoon seems to have no point, no conclusion and no satisfying ending. The colors change but the change has no meaning except to go from scene to scene.  It seems the main character seems unhappy about his mode of transportation and the complains about the speed limit.  So what?  I do not the cartoon and I do not think it is funny. This was a a real waste of time."
"This cartoon is very engaging. You just feel you need to keep watching to find out what situation the cartoon guy will find himself in next. The lack of coherent language is, to me, a positive, because you can insert whatever you would say in the same situation, based on the character's emotional reaction. I adored the colors changing in the background. It was soothing and just added something extra. The fact that the person drawing the scene is never seen other than his hand is really cool. He interacts with the cartoon character and the bringing together of their worlds is unique and makes this cartoon worth watching again and again."
The video was very creative. It was very meta in that the artist was in dialog with his subject on the page. With minimal use of line and color the video sowed very clever and funny situations. The changing background and nonsensical language provided variation. Both the Character and even the artist were engaging .I enjoyed the video . Children and adults will be entertained. I know you will like it too!
The cartoon was interesting and amusing at first. After a while It became very repetetive and dull. The music was annoying and so was whatever language the character was speaking. I like a lot of different cartoons but this is not one I would like to watch again. 
The video was less than engaging and does not keep the audience's attention very well. The language is very gruff and hard to follow. It was a simple cartoon video that did not feature a lot of characters or a great story line. It sort of reminded me of watching sesame street. This would be a good video to keep the attention of a small child just from the audio sounds. At times it would showcase the drawing ability of the author and was interesting in how the video showed the changes of the scene. Overall it was hard to follow and not at all interesting. There was no real storyline to follow in the video. 
"This cartoon is funny. The guy drives around and argues with a cop. I like the color changes and the minimalist quality of the  piece, however I would like some subtitles, as I have no idea what they are saying. I like how the colors change though, and especially when it turns red as it seems our protagonist is getting angry. I like how the cartoon centers around breaking the fourth wall with the ""artist"" changing different drawings as necessary. The cartoon has a nice flow to it, and doesn't get slow at any time. I'd watch more pieces from this artist. 8/10 would laugh again."
"The cartoon was not anything like I was expecting. When I envision a cartoon I think animation ,colors , loads of action along with something to laugh about. With this cartoon you were trying so hard to find the punch lines that it wasn't very enjoyable to watch. Making probably a one minute cartoon video seem like and hour. Background was boring with only a solid color behind a white man drawn from a pencil or in  other words a stick man. They did change the colors in the background to red , purple , green but I really saw no point to that as the colors should have signified something extraordinary  was going to happen but was let down when that did not happen. The language was not something I could understand as well so that may contribute to the fact that I didn't care for this cartoon and quite frankly found it very inadequate ."
"This cartoon was done in a very simple style.  There are no fancy computer-generated effects.  It consists of a simple line-style drawing.  The main character provides the plot line in this cartoon.  Even though the drawing of this character is not very detailed, you can still get a sense for the emotions he is experiencing.  He comes to interact with a police officer.  It's very interesting to watch them interact in an unknown language.  To me the language sounded mostly like Italian.  I would guess the mannerisms of these characters are based on Italians."
I thought the video was entertaining and funny. The character in the video was fun to watch. I think that the different color background made the video more engaging. It was creative and fluent. The character showed good emotion in the beginning. This set the stage for the rest of the video. The introduction of the second character was well positioned. It also help to escalate the emotion in the video. 
"This video is very simplistic and didn't really hold my attention. While parts of it were slightly amusing, I wouldn't choose to watch it again.  / The main character seems to have some sort of anger issue (changing background colors indicated this, maybe?) and was somewhat of a speed demon in that car. He didn't seem to want to follow the speed limit at all, which is why he was pulled over and ticketed by a cop several times. He would have been much better off if he had just continued to use the bike he was offered in the beginning of the video.  / The character didn't really have much of a face, just a rather large nose and a mouth and it wasn't in any kind of language I've heard before, just sounded like gibberish.  / "
"I really didn't like this cartoon. It just wasn't at all entertaining for me. I was amused a little that it sounded like the characters were speaking Swedish at times, though. I liked the idea of it, where the cartoon character talks to the artist and then the artist draws things for the character, but all around I found the main character to be annoying, and the traffic signs and all were getting boring. I'm not sure if it was supposed to be an educational cartoon about traffic and obeying the laws. If so, I'm not sure if I can rate how good a job it did. The color of the background would change a lot too, from green to blue, to red. It was a little odd, so I don't know what that was about. I did like the ending where the cartoon character fell off the cliff though. Probably because I didn't like him in the first place!"
"Really not sure what to think of the cartoon.  I have seen these types of cartoons where the drawing of the cartoon is part of the plot.  I am not really sure that i enjoy them.  In addition, the fact that the cartoon was in some other language, gibberish perhaps, makes the cartoon less enjoyable.  Furthermore, the changing of the background colors was odd and distracted from the cartoon.  I also did not understand the point of the cartoon, was the character a bad person that did not like to follow rules?  Why did they keep exceeding the speed limit?  All in all, I would not want to watch this cartoon again."
"I found this cartoon to be hilarious. The ""voice"" or ""language"" the main character with the gigantic ""nose"" spoke in was funny. You could see his emotions based on his tone and event he colors of the background. For instance, when got really angry the screen flashed red. And when he was cruising in his car going fast the background was blue. I found the cartoon very engaging. it moved at a fast enough pace to keep me interested in what was going to happen next. It took me back to classic cartoons where you didn't really need actual voice or words to display emotions and make a connection. The sounds in the video were enough for me to comprehend what was happening and get a thorough view of the ""world"" inside the cartoon. I really enjoyed it for what it was and found it worthy of viewing. "
"I did not like the cartoon what so ever.  First off, the cartoon being in a different language is off putting.  You have no idea what is being said, and there is alot being said, but you kind of get what is happening based on the actions of the hand.  Also the high pitched voice acting is also not good.  It is not pleasing to listen to that for almost three minutes.  The changing of the colors to me indicated when the character on the screen was doing something wrong or another character was about to be introduced.  Overall I did not like this video at all.  There was no entertainment value at all.  I will give one positive that the creator of the video has some decent editing skills to pull of the effects in the video, but that is the only positive for this video."
I found the cartoon confusing. I did not like the format. The main character was not engaging. I was unsure of the point of this cartoon. I did think this was something many people would enjoy. I watch a lot of cartoons and I would not view this one again. It wasn't clear to me who the main audience for this cartoon was. 
"The video was amusing even though it was in a foreign language.  Despite the language barrier, it was easy to understand the humor.  The drawing is very simple, but the video is so engaging in part because the off screen character with the chalk is able to change the landscape so that the cartoon character can proceed on his journey.  I also enjoyed the changing colors as it gave another dimension to the very simple drawings.  "
"This cartoon seemed to be Italian as that was the language they used throughout the cartoon. / The cartoon was basic and simplistic and revolved around a central character getting from one point to another. There seemed to be some underlying message in the cartoon. I believe the changing background colors during scenes had something to do with the emotions the main character felt during certain situations. Amusing at points, but overall it lost me in the translation of what it was trying to convey. I am still not sure if this was made to entertain children or adults. / For a low quality cartoon, I will give it a pass, but for entertainment value, I would have to say it fell quite short. Bugs Bunny, it wasn't. Maybe I missed the point of the cartoon, but I was not entertained. / "
"I really didn't find it that entertaining. The idea was simplistic and creative at it's core, but really it just took a pretty obnoxious twist with how the characters were developed onscreen and the sound discouraged me from wanting to watch it further. I just didn't particularly enjoy watching a cartoon where the main character was being a brat throughout and sounded much like one as well. There was no growth or repercussions until the very end when things finally fell and cut off. The changing of the colors also appeared unimportant for the most part."
"I really enjoyed watching this cartoon and I must say that it's a great piece of art. I really liked the idea and concept of it, as if the hand is God creating man and man being ignorant and greedy. If there is anything which character doesn't like or feels that it contradicts his ideas than he complains and asks the hand to fix it, regardless of consequences. The color pattern was also very interesting, I think it was representing the mood of the character. Overall I really enjoyed the video it was fun, enjoyable, engaging and thought provoking. The fact that I couldn't understand the language made it more interesting for me as it forced me to imagine what character is saying."
I found this cartoon to be very amusing. At first it may be unclear but as it progresses it seems that the intention will soon be made known. To me there were three important characters and the off-screen cartoonist seems to hold a very significant role. It is the cartoonist who is the protagonist. As the cartoonist they led the story in the direction that they wanted to. The drawing of the short line which lead to the cartoons ultimate conclusion was indicative of the power the cartoonist had. The language although not familiar to me was easy to interpret when following the cartoon images. The different seemed to remind me of different temperaments. On a whole it was quite interesting and easy to follow even with its simplistic guides. 
"First, this video uses a gibberish language. The language is very annoying and harsh sounding and almost mocks the Italian accent, which is discouraging. The graphics are very simplistic. The action is also very unrealistic; at one point, a police officer (?) pops up out of the trunk of a car. The most interesting aspect is the artist who is called upon to assist the main character. The main character, however, is very unlikable. He is always demanding the artist do things for him and is always complaining about having to follow the rules. The background colors are also unpleasant. They are perhaps meant to signify moods but they are ultimately just distracting."
The speaking terms of the cartoon where not understandable. The visual parts of the cartoon however where understandable to the mind of the viewer. To me the colors represented mood based on how the main character presented feelings based on authority figures judgement on the free will of the activities of the man characters behavior.
"This cartoon is both amusing and clever. The artist plays an active role in it, with the main character frequently arguing with him or her to change things in the story. It's fun to watch the artist change things or refuse to. The style is very simple, but still effective. The background changes colors occassionally, usually to indicate the character's changing emotions. For instance, when he's angry at a police officer it changes to red. The story is also amusing and would fit in in any comic book. The only problem is that because of that the story itself doesn't feel all that original. "
"The quality of the video is very low. The quantity of the video is very high and long and repititive. The concept of the video is very nice. The character is a boring comedic character. The audio was alright, and I liked the music. The colors were also nice. I did not entirely enjoyed the video. Overall it was an alright video."
I really enjoyed this video. I found it quite amusing. The whole concept that the main character can't seem to get what he wants works all the way through to the end. I have to admit that throughout the video I continued to think about how much more entertaining the video would be if I could understand what the character's were saying. 
"The video is very interesting. The story unfolds in a very unpredicatable way and the use of colors really helps convey the mood and situation that is occurring. Because of the ""mystery"" hand constantly becoming involved the main character is responsible for interacting with and at its behest. Its almost as if the hand is the characters mind/conscious. I think its a very creative way to tell a story with lots of different thoughts and emotions in a fairly short time. Because of it you want to pay attention to it. "
"The cartoon is in fact quite amusing and creative in its design. The language is foreign but it is fairly easy to understand what is happening. This to me would would work well to promote an automotive product, or transportation of some kind. The character off screen seems to be the authority or the entity that makes things happen. (Or not.) The emotions are illustrated I think with the changing of the colors from blue, green orange and purple. It is simplistic in nature but an easy compilation. The robot police officer to me seems significant to the enjoyment of the character's pleasure of transportation. "
"The video itself was somewhat boring and uninteresting. I was curious if it was in another language or if it was simply gibberish. Either way, the speech was kind of cute. I also liked the animation itself, which was simplistic and probably attractive to children. The audio quality was good. I thought the idea behind the video itself, however, was boring and not at all attractive to me. Maybe kids would like it, but I didn't. "
"The cartoon is super annoying.  The sounds that it makes will grate on your nerves.  It is a simple drawing that is manipulated into a story, which is kind of cool.  But otherwise this cartoon is not worth watching, or more importantly listening to.  I do not see many people going back for more of this sort of thing."
The video engages without using a specific language. The way there is always action and always movement on the screen is very interesting. The use also of one consistent character and the intermittent drawing on the screen gives a voyeuristic view. Are we looking at the life of one person? The changing of the main color on the screen gives it a very avant garde feel and hints at either an actual significance or a feigned significance. I feel one could rewatch the video and start to unravel the threads of deeper meaning in the cartoon. I think maybe that the cartoon is a commentary on the things we create. All in all I would highly recommend watching the cartoon.
I thought the video was unappealing and boring. It was not humorous and looked very dated. I can't imagine any child sitting through it and enjoying it at all. It was overall very boring and unimaginative. Easily forgettable. It may have been geared more towards adults. It was definitely not very funny.
"The cartoon video is annoying, grating and unfunny. The character's voices are irritating. The voices are high pitched and unintelligible which leaves the viewer straining to understand the language instead of enjoying the cartoon. The interactions between the characters was simplistic and in no way amusing. The artist who created the backgrounds, vehicles and signs for the main character seemed random and forced. I disliked the changing colors which seem to happen without rhyme or reason. Overall I didn't get a smile out of this and was annoyed by the sound so I would give this a solid thumbs down."
This video is filled with a dynamic of characters and colors. The story changes colors as the characters interact. The quality of the video was something out of a homage to cartoons from the 80's. The amusement value of the cartoon was pretty entertaining. The character that it is focused on has trouble following rules. You are thrown into a story in which the character struggles with rules and authority. The other side to this is how the authority handles the chaotic character. The authority makes it none that the chaotic character has broken a rule/law. You learn that rules in the cartoon are similar to the ones in life. The audio in the story is in a different language but can be somewhat understood with the expressions of the characters in the story. In order to gain an idea of what the story about one must pay attention to the characters and the color changes that occur in the video. 
"This video seems very familiar, I believe there was one similar years ago. It was very interesting but overall left me wondering what was it really about. The different language may have contributed to the overall confusion of what the point actually was. I did enjoy how the set was created by writing it in. Not sure if there was a point in changing background color but a couple times there was advertisement at the bottom which could be a distraction to some. I would like to view the video in my primary language to see if my perception would change because I do like the clip, it could be a little better. It is also a versatile cartoon that could transition into different topics, an ongoing idea or concept if you will."
"The fact that the cartoon is in a different language makes it hard to completely understand the concept of the cartoon. The idea of the cartoon is interesting in that the drawing communicates with the person who drew him to fix things that make him unhappy. I was still unclear at the end exactly what the purpose of the video was. I feel that there was a message about following the rules that they were trying to convey, but this was unclear. The policeman would appear on screen and the colors would change to a more harsh color. This seemed to signify that there was trouble happening, although due to the language barrier I'm uncertain. The cartoon developed at an even pace and you wanted to stay until the end to find out what happened. The ending itself was confusing in that I'm unsure why the character went off the road, which leaves remaining questions about the cartoon's purpose."
I didn't find the cartoon to be very interesting. It seemed like it was meant to be amusing but I didn't find the humor in it. I was also a little confused about what the message of the cartoon actually was. The plot didn't really make much sense to me. The animation was simple but it wasn't bad. It fit well with the type of story that was being told. The lack of dialogue wasn't really a problem for me because I think it was meant for you to try to interpret it on your own. Overall it just didn't do anything for me and I wouldn't want to see it again.
"I do like the simplicity of the cartoon. However, I believe their is a lack of creativity. Some people would call the simplicity art. I do not. I believe it could have been more thought out and creative. It was somewhat interesting, but a little hard to follow. The unchanging voices throughout the entire thing were a bit of annoyance. I did not like that. Still, it wasn't awful."
The cartoon was an interesting concept at first however as it went on got kind of annoying. It had a story line and had a different way of preventing it but the sounds the characters were making were also annoying. I would recommend considering changing the sounds to either no sound all together or something the viewer can understand. The cartoon also felt kind of long for something that wasn't even speaking anything I could understand. I thought the quality of it is was good. I felt like the story was well thought out by the person that wrote it. I also feel like the colors were meant to tell you something as to what the character was feeling but I was unable to figure that out. I felt like overall I would not want to watch this cartoon again as once was enough. 
"The cartoon was certainly engaging. I do not know if this was for children or not, however. The video was in a different language, so it was very hard for me to understand exactly what was going on. There was a debate in my mind about whether or not the characters in this video were angry at one another or if that was just the way the naturally communicate. The colors were also somewhat confusing to me as well. I do not know if there was a meaning behind the color changing or if it was just ""because"". I do not know who was talking to who at times. Overall, I think it was an engaging cartoon, but somewhat confusing!"
"The video was confusing, at best. The majority of the audio is more or less inaudible. I had no idea whether the character was speaking another language, or inventing his own. The point of the video also seems to be unclear. The main character spends it's time interacting with another character that is mostly off the screen, but again this makes the dialogue even more confusing. You can gather that the character is trying to travel, and does accomplish this with multiple vehicles. But again, because the point of the video is unclear, we aren't sure where or why. "
"The video is a bit unique an odd. The concept is interesting, though. The flow of the characters and the entire video itself was seamless. The main character is engaging and interesting to watch. It is unclear what language is used in the video. I think it adds a bit of mystery to it. I think children will enjoy watching this video. It is simple, yet will hold their attention."
"The video was very entertaining holding my attention until the end. The simplicity of the drawing was very imaginative and simple for children and adults. Even though it is presented in some sort of ""other"" language it still made it's point and kept you engaged. The different color backgrounds were a simple way of showing the temperament of the main character at that moment. I liked the idea of using the background along with the language to imagine what I would probably say in any of those situations."
