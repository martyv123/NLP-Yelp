# Implementation Details 

This is a minimal script that reads in the ten text review examples provided by Prof. Bart. The
script will parse, lemmatize, and perform a term frequency (TF) analysis on the reviews
provided in the sample.txt file. More specifically, it performs a TF-IDF analysis, which stands
for Term Frequency (TF) - Inverse Document Frequency (IDF). We then use the weighted values of
the terms in the reviews to compare the similarity between reviews by using cosine similarity. As we 
continue to analyze larger data sets, modifications will be added to script as necessary.

This script parses the sample review data and lemmatizes the individual reviews by creating tokens
for each term. Stopwords, such as "to", "the", and others were removed from the lemmatized list of
reviews. Punctuation was also removed from the lemmatized lists as it is not useful in determining
the relevance of a term in a document. Parsing and lemmatization was handled by the nltk library
which can be found [here](https://www.nltk.org/).

The term frequency, inverse document frequency, cosine similarity, and all intermediate matrix 
transformations were calculated using scikit-learn's library. You can find more information about the 
calculations and methods [here](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/classes.html#module-sklearn.feature_extraction.text).

This script will return the cosine similarity matrix of the reviews. The closer the value of cosine Î¸ is to 1,
the more similar the two reviews. A value of 1 indicates that the documents are identical.
