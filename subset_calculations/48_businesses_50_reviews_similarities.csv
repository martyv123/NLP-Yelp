 Yesterday I took my truck there. I got the Super Poly Wash. The attendant got in the truck and drove it up on the edge of the track. I got the attention of the other attendant who yelled at the driver that he was on top of the track. The driver, instead of backing up, cranked the wheel to the left and drove down into the channel roughly. So much for my alignment. 
 The attendant driver cleaned the truck at the other end. He was less than enthusiastic about this. When I got home I had to finish the job. The windows were dirty and there was dirt in every indentation on the truck. Couldn't see this at the car wash as it was still wet.

I've never had a Caesar with anything other then romaine and I don't care for spring mix so it would have been nice if they told us they didn't carry any other lettuce or I wouldn't have ordered it. The corned beef was basically all fat. My dog didn't even like it when we got home.

This has to do with the all you can eat fish places that we go to with regularity - Mentor Family Restaurant, Lakeshore Eatery, Mama Roberto's and Manhattan Deli.  

The fish tastes great at all of these places and the price is not unreasonable.  All give a good portion on the first plate.  It's thereafter that we have an issue.  One piece every 20 minutes - some a little better, some a little worse.  Those that ask how many you want, take longer.  

The management and owners need to take some things into consideration.  For our family, one person gets AYCE and the rest of us order from the menu.  That means 1-4 profit makers in our party of up to five.  We also come in at other times and spend money.  

The slow down only serves to make our fish eater stubborn and he isn't afraid to tell the wait staff what he wants, especially when he isn't getting it.  I'm sure the wait staff hate AYCE fish.  Tonight we had a different tactic to the slow down.  They ran out of fish. I have very rarely been at a place that runs out of anything.

I am sure we are not the only ones disappointed in this situation.  Again, I ask that management take some time to rethink how we can make everyone happy.

Mentor Oh.

How can you not love a place that gives you a plate of house made pickles when you sit down. Yumm.

We have herd about the Manhattan Deli from numerous friends that live in Mentor, so when we were at Roma's last hair appointment, we thought we'd drop in since it is right down the street form L&G.

When you first walk in, you see the classic deli counter with meats and prepared foods for purchase to take home. Corn beef, pastrami, Latka, ext. along with baked good and pastries.

Our waitress, Rhonda was a very pleasant and polite mature woman who was very informative and insightful of the menu and specials. She also came to the table with the plate of delicious pickles, so in my book she's awesome!

Since this was our first time, naturally I had a little tasting of many things to truly give an accurate depiction of our dining experience.

For starters, we ordered a hummus plate, zucchini sticks, and a huge Greek salad. 

The hummus was almost inedible, I don't know if it was the tahini or the citrus, but it did not taste anything like hummus, and it came with pre-packaged squares of pita that were so dry they were almost rubbery. 

The zucchini stick were thick spears coated in a crunchy thin breading, these were probably some of the best I had ever had. I could eat these all day. 

Roma and I shared the Greek salad; small baby olives, oil and vinegar, cucumbers, red onions, and a pile of feta. Pretty tasty!

For the main course we ordered Beef Shawarma, Falafel, and Latka. 

The beef was thin strips, over cooked with old seasoning caked on each strip. Even with all the seasoning, they had very little if no flavor at all. Sitting on a pile of chopped iceberg lettuce with pickled beets and a side of tahini, Yikes that's alotta salad!

I was so looking forward to having the falafel, but man what a disappointment. Again, they were so dry, I almost had to dip them in my water just to ensure I could digest them. No flavor what so ever.

Then there was the Latka, another disappointment. Yes it was cooked fresh, and yes it looked delicious. But they were bitter and almost sour tasting. Even with some apples sauce, I couldn't eat them.

The saving grace for this experience was the desert. Roma had the lemon cheesecake, and I had the carrot cake. Both were absolutely delicious, but wouldn't you know, they weren't even made by the restaurant, they buy them from a local bakery. Surprise!

I guess this is all do to my willingness to be daring, and seeking some true ethnic cuisine. Everyone that suggested this place recommended the brisket, or the pastrami. I wish we would have stuck with that. I am not writing this place off yet. I will be going back and trying some of the more popular dishes. When I do I will hopefully be able to rewrite this review.",2013-10-20 18:30:45,False,0.09928831572756779

My mom has been here on several occasions and has raved about it so we figured why not. Our stomachs had control at this point and honestly, soup on a cold day sounded very appealing. 

And it's not often you see both owners walking around the place asking you how everything is and if you could use anything. Really nice people who worked there.

Our waitress was killer awesome. She took our order by memory and we both ordered the corn beef hash that came with a bread roll, salad and two eggs for $7. Cool. 

When the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty. The portions were HUGE! My sister and I could've definitely split one. The bread was made by hand I'm 99% sure and was delightful. I ended up with a salad (which was also huge for a side salad...nothing fancy but fresh and homemade dressing) whereas the sis subbed in some clam chowder soup and insisted I try it. I don't like clams...well...not of that particular nature anyway. ;) It was really delicious and had great flavor and consistency. Not watered down or anything that would remotely resemble an instant soup.

My sister and I easily ended up getting containers for our food as there was no way we could eat it all. On the way out, I couldn't help but admire the cheesecake that called my name before me. It was their chocolate one (cannot remember the name of it as I was so mesmerized) and looked super rich but divine. I had to have it. So I got two. No, that wasn't my inner fat-kid talking...I bought one for my parents to split ya weirdos. The lady at the counter was super nice and boxed up the slices in a safe-transport container...which my car appreciated.

Definitely will be back to try other things. Really enjoyed it and their coffee kicks ass too. Very good, even black, with hints of chocolate in that too. Loved it! GO! Do it now! :D",2012-09-18 16:11:56,True,0.0922913603657277

The sides are terrific and I wouldn't pass up the potato salad, even though I really do despise mayo. It has too much flavor to be missed. You can't go wrong with any choice, from their bagels with lox (oh.. so tasty) to their Ruben, stacked high with corn beef and sauerkraut.

Food 4.5/5 let's start with the beef dip sandwich , the roast beef was thinly sliced extremely tender not dry at all with some decent flavour , stacked high , very generous portion , the bread was delicious soft perfect for this type of sandwich, now the only thing that would need an improvment is there au ju juice to dip your sandwich it was very bland almost like a chicken stock , needs improvment my only complain, my greek salad was great , generous portion loaded with feta cheese and a very nice dressing very fresh .

The place looks similar but different to the old Macy's that was there. Having never been to a Wimpy's before, I am guessing they all sort of follow that same red and yellow vibe. It was cheery enough. 

Having changed plans at the last minute, I had no idea what to expect from their menu. I was really hoping for a few healthier options, which I understand is a laughable concept at most diners. But come on! Even Denny's has whole wheat pancakes and egg whites on their menu. They did not have anything except for the offering of turkey bacon.

I opted to go with the AYCE omelette bar which runs every Saturday and Sunday. For $10.99, it seemed like a great deal as you could also get hashbrowns and mini croissants with your omelette. Ultimately, I liked being able to make my own semi-healthy choices. Kind of, but not really. If you are a big eater, then I would absolutely suggest the omelette bar.

I went to a trendy DT Toronto spot for my glasses and while the styles were great and the service was thorough, there was a disconnect with me having to go somewhere else to get my eyes tested before choosing my frames and lenses - a Wal-mart no less.

I walked in and wanted to ask about the headaches I'd been having since getting my new glasses and Dr. Allyson took my glasses and ran them under a special machine to examine exactly what my prescription was and what they were comprised of. Thankfully everything checked out and Dr. A explained that because this was a slightly stronger prescription than I was used to that headaches were normal and to be expected.

During the comprehensive eye examination, I got my pupils dilated. Be sure to bring a pair of sunglasses with you if you're driving - you will be sensitive to lights! Or you can purchase a fashionable pair in their dispensary. The clinic carries a great selection of brand name eyewear and sunglasses!

We also did something called Optomap wide-field retinal scan, which carefully and thoroughly checks the inside of the eye for any hidden eye diseases, monitors suspicious areas and changes from year to year, and confirms that everything is healthy!

During the visit, I also learned that Dr. Tang specializes in contact lens wear, LASIK consultation, and Ortho-K (AOK) overnight corrective contact lens for myopia control in children. You can also make an appointment online anytime using their real-time schedule - very convenient and easy to use.

Dr. Tang examined my boyfriend's eyes today and just by witnessing the procedure, it was one of the most thorough, most detailed and carefully done eye examinations I have ever seen, and I've witnessed quite a number of these at other eye doctors. The rooms she has in this business are all set up quite nicely and there is a lot of information at each station for the benefit and education of patients while they are in the process of waiting. The eye exam went smoothly and it seems Dr. Tang carefully sanitizes each tool she uses and makes sure they are acceptable to use on her patients. As I said, I've never seen such a thorough examination. She did things that my eye doctor has never done, which now makes me question him. She checked every part of the eye, making sure everything was healthy and regular. She put in eyedrops to dilate the eye for further examination of the inner eyeball- which was so cool because I've never even heard of this process. Every time she was doing something, she was explaining it in simpler terms so we'd understand and she would even pull up the screen on the computer to show my boyfriend the inside of his eyes and explain the different parts of it.

Not only is the food delicious:  Nice char on the burger, and for me the fries are amazing (I like mine on the softer side, and that's how they come here - although I'm sure they'd crisp them up for you if you ask), but the owner makes a real effort to make the experience a good one. 

The staff is definitely a real strength at this place. Although it's clear that of the two staff, one is more of a cook, and the other is more for taking orders and serving, both seem to be able to help each other out in most areas. 

I'll definitely be going back a lot. And I'm going to try my best to get through the entire menu in the coming months",2018-03-26 17:48:10,True,0.11233105517478073

Popped in for a late lunch. $7.50 special gets you a 4-oz burger with the usual fixings some fresh cut fries (really good) and a can o pop. 

Burger was  juicy and combined with the condiments made for a bit of a mess. But otherwise was very good. 

Not the biggest most filling lunch you can get around these parts but plenty good for the price. I was going to get lunch at the Harvey's at the nearby Home Depot and this was infinitely better for probably about the same price. 

The gourmet offerings were in the $14 or $15 range but I imagine they are bigger and have more stuff.

You can choose from 4 different buns and 9 different burgers. There's also the option of Classic Toppings & Premium Toppings. Moving on they have a list of specialty options like Reuben & Fish Sandwiches. There's also Poutine, Giant Onion Rings and different Fries options. 

I decided to go for a classic so I could really taste the meat, I obviously had to add cheddar cheese and I stuck with Classic Toppings like pickles, lettuce, onion, ketchup and mustard. What I really liked is that homemade taste, the meat had a good taste to it and it had a great char - just like a classic hamburger. The bun was very soft and all the toppings were great quality. I'm a huge Poutine lover so I had to give that a try, it was pretty good. The gravy tasted great and the cheese curds were squeaky. 

The owner had just finished making his own special burger which was being released the next day, and asked if I wanted to split it... um obviously. He had created a Greek Inspired Burger which was not bad, I preferred the classic though. 

I'd come back to try the Panko Crusted Chicken Sandwich & Onion Rings!

Their burgers are priced at the gourmet tier, which may turn some potential diners away, but their quality of meats and portion size are their trump cards. Take a look at my burger - It. Is. Massive!

Their variety is also refreshing. When you order a burger, you choose one of three buns: regular, seeded, and brioche. The family members are also helpful in advising about the best bun selection for the particular burger you're ordering, so don't sweat it.  I think the brioche bun would put a sweet spin on a chicken burger, so I'm eager to try that combination next.  In fact, I might like it more than chicken and waffles! Meat-wise, my Urbun Smoke had Montreal smoked meat in it and it tasted far better than bacon in a burger! The AAA beef patty was also not overcooked.

Find an ENT office that will explain what ""procedure"" you are going through before they do it to you.   Office staff is rude. The wait in the office was long and the phone call hold time is usually more than 16 minutes (average of my 4 cell phone calls). 

I was referred to an ENT for possible sinus thickening that was found as a result of an MRI for migraines.  I randomly chose Dr. Taffet due to his proximity to my office and his practice being in my insurance's preferred network.  After waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time, I was ushered into a room and the Medical Assistant sprayed each nostril with a spray, seemingly no different than I had used for sinus problems in the past.  She informed me the spray would numb my sinuses, so that the doctor would look in my nose. Shortly thereafter the doctor came in and listened to my five-minute verbal history of my sinus and headache issues and to find out why I was referred to an ENT.   He then took a long scope and looked into each nostril for literally one to two seconds per nostril. This procedure seemed no different than going to every other doctor's appointment where they use a light to evaluate eyes, ears, and nose, but this was with a longer ""scope"" for the nose than I was familiar with.  After this quick ""scope"" Dr. Taffet and asked me to have a CT since he could not fully assess my sinus issues without a CT.  When I asked why the MRI I had already received was not adequate, the Doctor said not good enough because it did not show the tissue he needed to assess.

I went for a CT for my sinuses and willingly paid the $75 co-pay.   I picked up my scans a few days later to return for my appointment where the doctor could tell me what was needed because I essentially learned nothing from my initial visit.    This appointment was later cancelled for the following reason:

Before my next appointment with Dr. Taffet, I was billed for a ""surgery"" at his office.  I thought there was a billing mistake, so I called the office to find out what occurred.  The medical billing office informed me that the ""nasal endoscope"" during my initial office consultation was a SURGICAL DEVICE, and therefore I was billed for a surgical procedure.  I informed her that I was not informed of a surgical procedure upon my initial consultation.  She told me that 9 out of 10 people that walk in the door are scoped.  I asked her if they were ever informed this would happen on their first visit.  She said, ""No, but they are all billed as surgery.""  I was stunned that other people were not shocked with this change and calling to question the billing office.  She tried to explain, ""Surgery can be charged when any device enters your body cavity, such as your nose.""  As a non-medical-biller myself, the logic seems flawed because my doctors have never charged me for surgery to look in my ears, nose, or throat.   Nor has any gynecologist charged me a surgical co-pay for a PAP smear, which is far more invasive.   Based on this logic, most doctor visits would be able to charge you for surgery.  My surgery co-pay is $150.  I was with the doctor for approximately six minutes and was NEVER TOLD I was to undergo a surgical procedure.  Having been properly informed, I would have declined this ""surgery,"" ESPECIALLY before having had my CTs evaluated.   Since the billing was not erroneous, I filed a complaint with my insurance.  They investigated it through their management and I can do nothing else through them.  After speaking to Dr. Taffet's office manager, Judy, she was unwavering and has been unwilling to change their policy (or my billing) of informing vast majority that their first visit will be a surgical co-pay ($150) instead of a specialist ($35) co-pay.

Consider St. Sharbel as an Eastern Catholic Church, where there are still main components as the Roman Catholic Church, the only difference is that the language that is used in some of the responses are in Aramaic (Jesus' language).

My grandma brought me here, as she has been visiting this church since Easter. She loves the sermons and the fact that this parish uses Aramaic within their masses. The church is nestled within a neighborhood, where there is still development going on. The hall is quite large, while the church is somewhat in transition as it is just a huge bungalow (the parish is raising money to build a nice church). But the decor of the church-bungalow was not your typical Roman Catholic design.

We couldn't get into La Carnita next door because of the ridiculous 2-hour wait, and DaiLo was packed - but by chance and kismet, LoPan (DaiLo's second floor tapas-style snack bar) had a table available, so following the orders of our hungry stomachs,  despite knowing nothing about the restaurant, we took a chance and had dinner here instead. We're so glad we did - sometimes, go with your gut. Stumbling upon even a random snack bar can bring you a satisfying, memorable meal.

First, the parking situation is decent. A block east of the restaurant are several small side streets where you can find free parking. If you can't find any, a decent amount of street parking around the restaurant is available. 

Second, the service. I just wanted to commend how wonderfully accommodating, professional, and friendly the staff were. They were aware of my shellfish allergy from the outset, and went out of their way to ensure that the Jellyfish Slaw salad wasn't ""shellfish"" and made sure I was able to eat it. 

Third, the food. Keep in mind that the orders here are all snack-size, appetizer-style, so don't expect a full-sized meal. We ordered: a) the Jellyflish Slaw, b) Truffle Fried Rice, c) Big Mac Bao (1 piece), d) Korean BBQ short ribs, e) KFC popcorn tofu. 

The Truffle Fried Rice and the Jellyfish Slaw were definitely the stand-outs - delicious flavours melding sweet and salty with the comforting feeling of chomping on fried rice, along with really interesting textures in the Jellyfish Slaw (it wasn't slimy, but super crunchy and delicious). I would pass on the Korean BBQ ribs (it's basically something you can make at home, and is really nothing special).

Overall, for portion size, the value isn't that great (I don't think $19 for the Truffle Fried Rice was warranted, given how small the portion was). But, regardless, the quality of the food is there, and it was a great meal. 

For two people, with tax and tip, we paid around $63.",2016-02-17 04:10:39,True,0.10302025137095301

The service was very accommodating and attentive despite the fact that The Shangri-La was hosting a staff party at LoPan that night. 

The bartender was a most personable and skilled fella who made some fantastic off the menu cocktails including one made on the spot we decided to name White Rabbit for the night. He also managed to get me hooked on Brooklyn(s) (the less famed but more delicious cousin of a Manhattan) and engaged us in conversation about growing up in Ireland. 

The dim-sum style menu was also quite impressive and exceeded our expectations. The famed Big Mac Bao was every bit as good as the hype would suggest. Who really can resist a Big Mac baked into a bao?! My second favourite dish was the Asian confit duck wings with nut crumble. I love anything duck, but had never tried anything like this. Simple but absolutely delicious. The trout and KFC tofu were also delicious, as was the secret menu item you will have to find out about on your own ;) The only mid disappointment came from the Korean BBQ short ribs which were not as good as ones I have had in Markham restaurants, but the quality of service and other delectable food and drink offerings more than made up for it.

On Tuesday, December 22, I had the misfortune of being rudely treated by one of the employees, Eric. I was in complete disbelief that I was being treated so unprofessionally. His encounters with me were certainly not an isolated incident, as many people were treated rudely as well. When they would ask him for a quick second, he would sternly cut them off and tell them that they would have to wait for him to finish what he was doing. This happened to other customers several times, and to me, twice. Even with little questions such as ""is this where I stand in line"" or ""do you guys sell gift cards"". When he was behind the counter, he was rolling his eyes and talking badly about the customers walking around the store. 

When I was checking out with my purchases, he rudely talked down to me as if I did not know what I was purchasing and then proceeded to practically throw the receipt at me. 

The entire visit and my entire experience with him leads me to believe he either absolutely hates his job or was just angry and can't help but to take it out on customers, who solely look to him for help. I'm sorry it's such a hassle that you have to help out customers and do your job, Eric.

Both the sales reps and ""managers"" here are an absolute joke. Every time I've gone in here, I've been treated extremely rudely. Forget about not being helpful at all, and when you DO ask for help they're sighing and have looks on their faces like they're being inconvenienced. But the last time I was in there took the cake: the manager Bree and sales rep Sarah humiliated me in front of other customers by ganging up on me when I tried to check drapery panel lengths. Apparently, you're not allowed to check items before spending money on them in their store. I was talked down to as if I was a child and was being disruptive. No reason for bullying me other than to get a thrill and exert their ""authority"" on me, the PAYING client. 


FURTHERMORE, I get home that evening and half the items I purchased were BROKEN. When I called to let them know I was on my way back to the store to exchange them, Bree tells me not to bother coming down, that there's nothing he can do for me since when I left the store, everything was in good condition. WHAT??? And how would you know since you didn't check the items in their boxes and lord knows I didn't since apparently I wasn't allowed to! So now, $600 later, my stuff is broken and there's nothing he can do??? Even though I left the store 30 mins ago??? WHAT A NIGHTMARE!
 

I go in for a nice evening shopping and I come out totally traumatized. It's a shame. There's no upper management watching them so it's literally a free-for-all. Store culture is a disgrace and MUST be changed, as staff there are absolute BULLIES.

The store was very clean and the employees were very helpful. The employees promptly took my order and made my pizza right in front of me. I just opted for a plain pepperoni pizza. The process took every bit of 10 minutes if that, the employee wrapped my pizza up and told me I could grab a tub of cookie dough behind me in the refrigerated shelves. The tray the pizza sits on was a little flimsy so I had to be careful carrying it. 
The instructions are included in the packaging and I went home and put the tray and pizza in the oven for about 10 minutes and it was ready. The pizza was bubbled up which made me panic but eventually went down after I took it out of the oven.

That's right, you come here, get your pie, take it home, and bake it yourself. This really threw me for a loop the first time I stopped by a Papa Murphy's but when you get it home and bake it right, you're getting an extremely fresh pizza for a great price.

They assemble the doughy pizzas right in front of you and wrap them up. The staff here is very friendly and will make sure you know exactly how to bake the pizza. The instructions come with the directions for all of their styles so it's nice for them to make sure you're not baking a thin pizza with deep dish instructions.

My favorite is the thin crust. So crispy, almost like flatbread. The sauce is light and fresh, a bit peppery than most which I appreciate. The pepperonis get slightly crunchy on the edges if you bake it right and I love it.

Along with pizza, they also do cheese breads, salads, cookies, and cinnamon desserts. They have Pepsi products so keep that in mind if you're a Coke addict like me.

Check out their website for all kinds of different specials, offers, and coupons. They currently have a Yelp offer as well! I believe if you order online they also have a discount. Family size pies are $10 on Tuesdays. For as fresh of a product as your getting, the deals are a win-win.

To our surprise some of the same people (who were in street clothes) were actually workers and went behind the desk speaking very loudly and cursing, not even caring that we are standing at the desk as customers. How can a place be this unprofessional. The walk to the room I must say was very uncomfortable. There were a group of guys hanging outside in the back corner of the hotel smoking and starring at us as we were walking across the street to the second building. Maybe they thought they knew us, but it was a little awkward since they starred the whole time gesturing and laughing with each other. We got into the building and approaching the second floor there was a strong smell from what it seemed to be marihuana from the strong musty smell, or some other drug. Either way it was very unpleasant and not a smell any hotel should be proud of. We unfortunately had to deal with that disgusting smell THE WHOLE TIME we stayed here. I let the front desk know about the smell after day one since I could not get in touch with the manager who happened to be away for the whole time we stayed here, which was another inconvenience, for emergencies, how can the owner not be around? The room wasn't bad, we were fortunate enough to have a decent room at least, but the look was very old and outdated. Doesn't compare to the pictures online at all. We had maintenance come to fix our shower head, the water was spitting out in all directions. The maintenance guy was young looking, but very nice and made me feel comfortable with fixing the shower while I ran out for food. I came back and he showed me how he fixed it, it was perfect. I believe his name was Loe/Leonard. By that night, it seemed more rooms filled up with more check ins and more smoke was filtering through the hallways and stairwell. It was so horrible. Due to my bad experience since day one, I really doubted anything would happen and I was right. We stayed for four days and every day got worse. The breakfast crew were full of smiles, but the food itself seemed old and cheap, so we ended up eating out everyday. If you want to party and not get in trouble for doing illegal things, come stay here, because they seem to not care at all.

Someone was obviously smoking when there were signs posted that it was a non-smoking hotel. The worst part of the stay was a large group of thugs had booked several rooms and had music that was audible from the hallway. You also could smell marijuana from the hallway as well. There were 15+ cars in the parking lot, all backed in, obviously intentional-to hide their lic plates/planning for a quick getaway? Who knows. My family and I were unfortunately placed one the first floor with them and beside the exit door. We heard them in/out, hanging outside all night. These people seemed quite comfortable in this environment which tells me that they use this hotel often without repercussion. I also feel that the management is aware, or else they would not allow such type activities to go on without contacting the police. Maybe they were most interested in selling out the hotel that night, but in doing so, you put other guests at risk and lose future business from the type of clientele that you should be trying to attrack. This was not an isolated incident for sure and was not just a group of young people having a good time. There was definately illegal activity going on by some unsavory individuals. At checkout, a group of them were standing at the exit door smoking with a bottle of liquor (kid you not) sitting on the window sill. As a non-smoking hotel, There should be a smoking area away from the building or don't allow it all.

I checked in to TownePlace Suites in the University Centre area. It was nice to be completely out of the downtown core.

I parked and checked in to the hotel. I had a friendly and fun person at the front desk. She asked whether I needed a late checkout, for she recognized that I was a gold elite member. I said that I needed to catch a flight in the morning, so I wouldn't need it.

My sense of humour made her laugh hard. I asked where the elevator was or if I had to haul my belongings up flights of stairs. She was kind to tell me where it was.

My room felt like home. It is an older hotel, but it worked just fine for me. The bed was comfy. The kitchenette was perfect. The shower pressure was fine. I had no complaints.

I got a bag of shrimp potstickers, and made them for breakfast and dinner on two separate days. I brought dinner in on my final night and was pleased that I had a decent meal in the comfort of my room. It truly felt like home.

More importantly, I slept well. It was far too noisy at the other hotel. I was well-rested at this hotel.

Housekeeping was great. My room was made every day. Everything was clean and perfect.

There are a bunch of eateries and shopping within a short drive. Check out the IKEA area that has plenty of stores to discover if you are staying here.

I stayed here for a week from July 25th until July 31st. I'll start with the good things. I had a a suite, and it met my expectations. It had a full kitchen, 1 bathroom, 2 bedrooms, TV in every room, plus a living room area. Every day the house keeping was superb. They didn't leave anything untouched, and even washed my infants bottles for me! All of the staff here was very friendly and attentive. Breakfast was very simple and the the same thing everyday (except on weekend they added waffles), but that doesn't matter much to me. It was a meal my kids could eat and I didn't have to cook or spend additional money to eat out for breakfast. They have a pool which was well maintained, clean, and a comfortable temperature... 
Now, the bad. There is only one elevator, which is located on the complete other side of the hotel. I actually thought they didn't have one at first because I had to search for it. So, for a family with young kids, this can be a huge hassle. Lugging 4 kids up and down 3 flights of stairs wasn't fun. Also, on my last night here, a huge cockroach (or waterbug?) came out of the utility closet and into the living room area... I caught it in an empty baby food jar and immediately called the front desk. I spoke to Nikki and she handled the issue promptly and was very VERY understanding and apologetic. She let me know to come back down in the morning when the GM was there. I did go back in the morning and spoke to Ryan, the manager. He addressed the issue and was also understanding. He handled the situation the way I expected (offered or comp or give my points back) and offered his sincere apology for the gross inconvenience.

1.  Throughout the afternoon and evening, staff members hung out right outside the front door smoking cigarettes and clustering the entrance way.

2.  The coffee was watered down that was offered in the lobby and breakfast.

3.  The breakfast has typical offerings:  coffee, juice, yogurt, fruit, grits, oatmeal and muffins, but the hot food (eggs and sausage) were very, very dry.

5.  The structure of the building and hallways were tight and confusing.

Almost everything about this store is wonderful, the people who work here are so sweet and helpful - there's one older man who works produce and I just love his face, so friendly and he always says hello... The produce is of excellent quality and if you are looking for a specialty item (mostly Asian but also Italian, other European products and just a bunch of random stuff) this is the place where you're likely to find it... And if they don't have what you're looking for, ask them if they can order it and they might just order it specially for you - I know this because that's what they did for me one time and it didn't fully surprise me but it made me love this place even more. Their sale table is the best kept secret in the city (although probably not so secret anymore, because I went today and it was already bare lol) on it you'll find perfectly ripe and ready to eat fruits and veggies for so cheap (and bread that is still good but not super fresh, but ridiculously cheap), because they don't let any of their produce go bad, as if they refuse to sell bad product to customers - it's amazing.

Even if you just want to walk around the aisles and check out the interesting and unique products that they have, you won't be bored or disappointed.. And they have a huge selections of organic stuff.

The only thing is that, since they are a small store, they don't have a butcher so you could technically do all of your grocery shopping here so long as you go somewhere else to buy your meat.

But they do have an awesome sandwich station where you can have someone build you a wrap or sandwich and they are so reasonably priced and very tasty and they, of course, use the freshest products. They also bake fresh breads and pastries every morning, you can go at 8am and you'll see them pulling trays out of the oven to cool.. And they have pastries like meat patties and focaccia pizzas...

However, because I am purist, unless I am listening to Classical Music live or on Vinyl played through an audiophile stereo (no 5.1 or 7.1 here, yuck!), don't even bother sharing.

So, when my friend acclimates me to the Downtown Chamber series; wherein Classical Music's top local talent plays at certain venues several times a year in a more intimate and informal environment, I was immediately intrigued by the idea.

He did inform me that they do play in uncharacteristic venues, that may or may not be sonically fine-tuned to such a precise musical art. 

Nevertheless, he had me at Informal!

You see, my wife doesn't quite like the formality and stuffiness that accompanies the enjoyment of Classical performances at Symphony Hall. Therefore, I often go solo while dressed up in my myriad of tuxes - even though I'm happily and delightfully attached.

What I was apprehensive about this particular performance was the fact that it was at the Monorchid, which is billed as an Industrial art type venue. It is often used to display local artists and their modern art. And on occasion, this venue is used for more formal events like weddings and such.

This was going to be a challenge. However, we got to wear jeans, sit on non-padded chairs, and enjoy some of Arizona's local virtuosity.

And virtuosity, it was!

The violins, oboe, double bass, clarinet, and viola all sounded so spectacular and sonorous. The combination of wood wind and stringed instruments, both masterfully performed in solo and group performances were simply magnificent.

We were seated in the back of the venue. This is because, except for the occasions wherein we always sit at the foremost seats; my shy wife prefers to sit away from wandering eyes of the crowd that easily fixates itself on the front seated patrons.

This venue should've been a train wreck of epic proportions. Concrete floors. Industrial metal panels. Open wood. The list goes on. But, the careful arrangement of the stage's wall, that deadened standing waves, and minimized the harmonics; made enjoying these performances such a pleasant surprise.

The only downside to this venue is that the parking is sparse. Unless you get here early, like we did, you will be hoofing it for some distance to get to the venue. The bathrooms are not equipped to handle 100 people in such a small space. And if it rains (which it did during this evening's performance), you can either get stuffed inside with the crowd, or try to find ample enough protection from the rain should you opt to stand outside to get some fresh air.

1.) They stole my security deposit, a measly $200, and refuse to answer emails and calls regarding the issue, for over a month.  I paid in full for the entirety of my lease and left the space exactly as I found it.  I even offered to leave the key a month early, because I wanted to get out of the space. However, he refused to accept the key a month early and refused to release me from the lease, so I paid the final month in full.  I did return the key late (not 7 weeks late), because I moved out of state.  Monorchid never got in contact about the key, never reached out, or gave notice.  There is nothing in the lease about returning a key on a specific date.  The owner, Wayne Rainey, thinks he can just screw people over if they are a small business or they live out of state.  
2.) The Monorchid runs an unofficial commercial kitchen in the rear gallery.  There are no sprinklers back there in case of fire, there is no ventilation or range hood.  Is that safe? A weekly occurrence is visible smoke and grease odors wafting into other areas of the building.
3.) The internet connection is verrrry slow.  Sometimes it would slow to a crawl, which is unacceptable for a coworking space.  The private coworking WiFi password was commonly shared with non-members and during events.
4.) Although they claim to be a 24/7 coworking space, their main priority is as an event venue.  They host weddings every weekend and you would be hard pressed to try and get work done in full view of the wedding guests.  If you have to work on weekends, this space is not going to be a good fit.

If you are thinking of renting at the Monorchid, hosting a venue or even dropping by for the gallery, then you should know that you are supporting a serial misogynist, who gives zero f#*ks about stealing from you, much less treat you with a modicum of respect.

It was the exact atmosphere we were looking for, we didn't want a cheesy banquet hall with floral carpets or a golf course like most people do and we didn't have a lot of money to spend on other places.  This place was right in our budget and was easily one of the highlights of my wedding. Riette runs the place and she couldn't have been more enjoyable to work with, she was easy going and didn't really put a lot of restirctions on us for what we could or couldn't do.

Overall, with some family members in the wedding industry, it's hard to find things that are new to them and have that wow factor. This place just had it all.",2010-12-01 21:17:17,True,0.12247426602533093

OK, I've seen  way more than my share of brewpubs...  So far, I've only partaken of their beer, but they also serve sandwiches and bar snacks that I'm looking forward to trying soon. 

With all of the brewing establishments in Dane County, you might be asking why you should trek over to Westport for a beer.  There are a lot of good reasons to come over to Parched Eagle.  First and foremost, the beer.  Their flagship IPA, Hop Bearer, is fantastic.  I rank it up there with the best of them, Ballast Point, Fantasy Factory, Ale Asylum's Ballistic, Green Flash, Three Floyds, and Toppling Goliath.  Crane Ale APA is also very good (I'm enjoying one from a growler at home while I type this review), and the American Strong Ale they served for Craft Beer Week was a treat.  I'm super stoked for the Imperial IPA next weekend.  

The people at Parched Eagle make it a lot of fun to pop in for a pint.  Jim, the proprietor and brewmaster, is a great host, as are all of the folks I've met working at his establishment.  

Located in a vanilla mixed use (businesses on the bottom, apartments on top)strip center, you'll be pleasantly surprised when you walk in.  Right up front is a beautiful bar: its base is made out of - get this - antique pianos - and the top is natural hardwood (think a tree that's polished).  There's plenty of seating at and around the bar, a large room to the side that's great for a larger group, and has a couch with a coffee table and games, and a brand new patio with several 4-tops with umbrellas - really nice.  The brewhouse is right behind clear plexiglass so you have a great view of where the magic happens.  

If Westport still seems like an out of the way spot, let me share some stats with you.  It's roughly 15 minutes from Middleton via Route M, and around 20 from downtown - not as long as you might think and I promise it's worth the trip!",2015-07-11 02:45:21,True,0.10069155566060312

It's always interesting to walk by Build-a-Bear and watch people with kids (and some younger adults) tilt towards the store like it was a gravity well. Cute stuffed animals will do that, I guess.

With two little girls, BBW is a common destination for us. We may have more bears that my daughters can remember names, but no way does that mean less is more! Nor the higher prices once all the gear kids want to buy is factored in. It's something of a right of passage at this point.

On the cool side, BBW has some cool special issue bears throughout the year that keep things fresh; the store is relatively clean, and the stuffing process makes the bears more special that ones off a shelf.

Only real drawback is that you need to turn the air conditioning temp down to make it tolerable (however, it's summer and temps here average 105-110 outside).  I was never uncomfortable, but just had to learn the thermostat a bit better.  Front desk staff were all friendly and more than accommodating.  Workout room is also well-appointed, and across the hall were two washer/dryer combos which were available for complimentary use.  Pool was small but a nice setting; I didn't use it so can't comment much.  
This location also has a bar/restaurant combo; food at the table was delightful but pricey.   Another co-worker was disappointed in the room service food quality and said it seemed as though it has been prepared earlier and re-heated.  The best part of my entire stay was the conference buffet...the chef, Stan Charles really goes above and beyond to prepare a wide variety of food and it all exceeded my expectations.  Very fresh and innovative, as well as accommodating to any dietary restriction. Although my pics aren't the best, it was seriously the buffet style food I've had!  
Although I didn't use the valet service, the day shift employee was super helpful with directions/recommendations.  He never failed to greet us with a smile when we came and went.  
Not sure about the bad reviews here...it's not a luxury resort, but it was very clean and well-appointed.  Suited my needs perfectly!",2018-07-02 02:26:07,True,0.07922729646189322

We discovered bright RED BLOOD on a pillowcase, flat and top sheet. Absolutely disgusting. It was abundantly clear that our sheets had not been changed since the previous guests. The blood had even soaked onto the mattress pad. 

When I went downstairs to alert the staff, we were not offered a new room, we were given new sheets to put on ourselves instead ... the sheets were for a full bed, not the king we had. We ended up sleeping on two flat sheets placed across the bed.

I have never been so angry in a public place. If I were not on a family vacation and if it had not been 10 p.m., I would have stormed out.

The next morning the bloody sheets that I had put into the hall were gone. I went down to discuss the incident further with the manager and found that the manager on duty had no knowledge of the events of the previous night. I pointed him to the photos that I was instructed to send the hotel's email. He reviewed and said that before doing anything he would need to see the issue in person - I reiterated that the bloody sheets were no longer on the bed, I had placed them in the hall and they had been picked up. I once again pointed to the pictures. 

After some time the manager offered to give me the ""employee rate"" for the night. Unacceptable. By that logic, a Marriott employee could conceivably expect to sleep in dirty sheets (and in this case IN BLOOD) each stay. Throughout the entire experience, I was made to feel as though it was my word against the managers.

I want to first say the staff was nice and helpful and the hotel was nice, clean and a good location since we were there for spring training and we were close to the stadium we needed to go to.   The problem we are having is that we called before we booked the vacation package through the agent we used.  We wanted to make sure  they had handicap rooms with two beds.  This is something we do all the time since we need to have two beds.  If the hotel says they only have a king then we don't book with them.  The hotel staff assured us that they had a two bed handicap room.   So we called back the agent and booked the hotel with handicap room.  When we go there they didn't have this room and the first night we stayed in a room with two beds but the bathroom was so small it couldn't be used by the handicap person who was on the trip.  The next day they moved us to the handicap room and brought in a roll away bed which worked but it wasn't what we paid for.   After the trip when we got back and talked to the agent and the long and the short of it was we did get some money back from the trip.   The bottom line was that we did have a nice time at the hotel.",2012-04-08 16:09:54,False,0.12206472617825884

The front desk had horrible communication problems.  Even the one nice girl who tried to be helpful didn't seem properly trained and kept throwing her co-workers under the bus for the mistake instead of taking responsibility (poor team work, come on people) and just making it right.

In the end (after WAY too much negotiating on my part) they gave me a different room, which I had to pay over $100 extra per night (which they tried to tell me is the best discount their manager will allow). I said I should at least get free breakfast for this crap and they FINALLY decided they could let me have 1/2 off (gee thanks).

Majority of us made PAN-ROASTED CHICKEN BREASTS (CAULIFLOWER STEAK for the vegetarians) WITH WHOLE GRAIN MUSTARD, LEEKS AND TARRAGON; SWEET CORN, TOMATO AND PANCETTA RISOTTO; PAN CON TOMATE (GRILLED BREAD WITH TOMATO); and HONEY LAVENDER ICE CREAM. 

This experience was more than just following a chef and his recipe, it was also a learning experience and boy did I have some bad habits I need to work on at home. Like the proper way of holding a knife to have the most control. Chef Adams caught me every time I revert back to my old habit. 

And of course the best part is eating the dish. After plating it up in a presentable manner, we got to stuff our face in the dish we made and it was so surprising to find the dish even more delicious than what you'll find at some restaurants.

Pros:
- The pasta was a hearty portion
- The dishes tasted nice
- The assistants were very nice
- The chef was very nice
- Facilities were clean and the assistants were constantly cleaning up after us

Cons:
- The entire experience felt disorganized from start to finish
- The chef seemed incredibly uncomfortable with public speaking and often receded into himself during instruction. There were times where he would be in the middle of an explanation, struggle to find the words, and then just stop talking and perform the task hoping that others would understand by watching
- The recipes were different from what was promoted on the website which was a great disappointment to the group I attended the session with
- From the beginning the chef said that we were making ravioli, and told us to roll the dough out to ravioli size. Then halfway through the class (after the dough was already rolled out) he  corrected himself by saying ""oh actually we are making raviolo"". This caused many people to struggle since they did not roll their dough out to the correct width.
- Promotion of items in store was annoying. I don't want to listen to a 5 minute spiel about useless gadgets...teach me how to cook.
- The chef was reading the recipes from a paper....and sounded surprised to learn what we were making. 
- Lack of information about dough making. He would just say things like ""we are using 00 flour"" without any elaboration on that.

I took the Thai cooking class at Sur La Table this week, which advertised instruction for pad thai, chicken curry, pork larb, and mango rice pudding. Overall, the class was underwhelming, rather boring, and not terribly informative. 'Cooking' is a generous description for what actually happened. The class was about 11 people with 3 prep stations and 2 stove burners, which was too crowded to get any hands on experience. As a result, most of the class consisted of standing and watching other group members simmer pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients in a pot. While we ate portions from all 4 meals, as individuals we only prepared about 1/3 of the final product. It would have been more interesting and way more informative to spend the money on ingredients and bumble my way through this at home. I have taken a Thai cooking class in the past, and this was pretty bad in comparison.

While the class overall took about 2.5 hours, a large majority was spent focused on shopping-related information. There was a sizable break in the middle for shopping and the teacher spent much of the class talking about products (i.e. knives, mortar & pestles), rather than talking about the actual process of cooking. The instructions that were given were vague and complicated to understand. 

Overall, not a huge fan of a class with this breadth and size. Before booking check and see what the total class enrollment is. Similarly, I think a class with fewer foods being prepared may be more worthwhile.",2016-01-21 21:12:33,False,0.10630825542362052

The thing about Canada Computers is, it's affordable enough and easy to get served and get your item (most times).

Anyone remember the CC employee who got shot by a disgruntled customer at Pacific Mall last year??  It's all coming together now...

And beware, they are extremely shady bastards when it comes to repackaging returned/exchanged goods and selling them as brand new.  Do a very good inspection on whatever you're buying, because these guys are as wormy as they get.

Lastly, I'd say their price matching policy is a complete joke.  It literally says ""to put it simply, if we can do it, we will""..  So you're basically saying, any pricematch is dependant on whatever mood you're in for that day?  Blech.

With over 2000 acres of wood land, there are plenty of places to explore. Around 14 miles of horse trails and more than 20 miles of beautiful hiking trails, too. Just a great spot to get outside and away from our technologically driven society. 

There is a great hiking loop around Lake Haigler for any and all experience levels. Around 1.2 miles for the full lap and a perfect view of colorful leaves in the fall. 

Should you get a moment to stop by the stables, there are 80 or so horses (some boarded and others owned by the barn) to pet and chuckle at. Some of them have quite the personality when they see a sweet child admiring their large size and fluffy winter fur. 

The Greenway offers lots of great events like the Fiddle n' Pig Shindig, which is a BBQ contest and festival in the fall. The Summer Concert Series runs June through August and while it's very hot out, the Comporium Amphitheater is at the bottom of a small hill and under several large trees to shade its audience.

Anne Springs Close Greenway, like others have noted, is just a short car ride south of Charlotte in South Carolina. If you are a resident of South Carolina, I think you can get a membership or get in for free. If you aren't, like me, bring some cash and pay the entry fee. 

Bring a picnic and take your time strolling the trail. You'll pass by some old homesteads, one of which belonged to Billy Graham's grandfather. This was an ideal spot to take my mom and mother-in-law. They loved it! You can also bring your pup, but make sure you bring doggie bags to clean up behind him. 

It's an ideal location to take your family portraits; it is picturesque with open fields, wooden cabins, or fields of horses. When my husband and I were there we saw many families posing and getting great rustic shots and I'm sure their holiday cards look picture perfect.

There is also camping allowed on the property.  I'm sure there's more this park offers but that's only the parts I saw.

The barn is quite large and they turned one of the silos into a tower where you can climb the steel stairs inside the silo and view across the park.

There's a trail indicating the great wagon road which was used by traders in early settler days.  I found this very interesting because one of maps indicated the path and it went through the area where I grew up in Pennsylvania.  So I have my connection to up north at this park.  :)

There's a small waterfall off the back of Haigler Lake that is worth a picture or two as well as the lake.  On my last visit there was a kayaker fishing on the lake.

For birdwatchers, there's a lot of bluebird activity in this park.

The term ""greenway"" here is used as meaning a ""nature preserve"", unlike the most of the greenways in Charlotte which are paths along creeks.  ASC Greenway is a 2300 acre privately owned nature preserve, owned by the Springs/Close family.  They made a fortune in textiles (we have some Springs towels in our house) but merged with a Brazilian compnay a few years ago and most, if not all, of their local mills are now closed.  As development was beginning to encroach the area, the family decided to leave this piece of earth to be undeveloped - and to also be used as education for nature and the environment.

The headquarters of the Leroy Springs & Company www.leroysprings.com is an old house dating back to the 1700s and was once occupied by the family.  It's the type of house that looks like it would be haunted and you'd see on Ghost Hunters.  The house sits at one of several entrances to the greenway.  This is the one near the ""dairy barn"".  Springs Farms used to sell milk, and this is where the cows were.  Though you can still see a few cows roaming in the field, the dairy barn has been converted and is now used for hosting events - including weddings.  There are also some horses, goats, donkeys, and mules near this entrance.

The greenway has many trails - all of which are open for walking, and some which are shared for horses and mountain bikes.  There are a few lakes, one with a nice one mile trail to walk around, campsites, animals, historic buildings, creeks, a small nature center, the original ""Nation Ford"" road which was a covered wagon trail, and a lot more.  There are often kids events, bird watching walks, and other events like their annual Earth Day celebration which is each April (the ASC Greenway opened on Earth Day so it's also their birthday).

Daily admission is a mere $3 for adults.  At most entrances, you put your cash or check in a pre-printed envelope and tear of the tab with numbers that match the envelope, and place said envelope in a drop box.  One of the entrances is also usually staffed.  The daily admission gets you unlimited access to the trails, but you must be a member to fish.  Also, the only entrance for bikes is behind the Leroy Springs Rec Center which is a little further into Fort Mill.

ASC Greenway is an absolutely beautiful nature preserve with a lot of history in it.  I'm glad it is very close to mi casa, and I never get tired of going there.  You can easily spend a day here hiking, biking, etc, so pack a picnic and go check it out.",2011-04-15 01:55:19,True,1

This is one of my wife's favorite stores and they do have a wide variety of house wares of all kind and there are some great deals to be had as well but it's never going to be guaranteed or consistent.  If the item you're looking for is gone, it could be gone never to be seen again.  Because of that there's a sort of ""act now"" impulse you may have to consider.  What's there today could be gone tomorrow so to speak.

The store for all the things that come and go is relatively kept in an orderly fashion.  There's a gauntlet type display sort of like what Best Buy has so you can line up while seeing things such as chocolate and such on the way to the check out.",2017-01-03 16:29:46,True,0.11570941242575795

Here's a heads-up: do not put anything on hold!  If you're on the fence or want something but don't have the means to transport it home right away, buy it - you can always return it.

One of the nice employees offered to hold some bar stools for me.  When I went to back to buy them, they were gone.  I inquired with one the rude employees and her snarky response: ""well, you should have bought them because items are put on hold all the time and other customers just rip off the tags and then go and purchase them; this happens all the time!""  I explained that the manager was even there and he didn't explain that to me. Her response: ""it's not his job to walk around the store and monitor your stools!""  Two days later I visited the store and guess what?  The stools were there displayed on a pedestal!  I was about to lose my mind but I quickly bolted to the cash and bought them instead!

I casually mentioned to an employee on how busy they were and she responded that people who live in the area are in the know that the store carts out their new stock every day at around 10:00am.

Customers follow staff as they push their filled carts from the storeroom to the display areas, taking items off them at random. Apparently mass produced items are in high demand.

We were in Arizona for our babymoon and made stops at L'auberge de Sedona, Antelope Canyon, and Grand Canyon. Our flight flew in and out of Phoenix. 

We allotted some time to be foodie adventurists in Phoenix on the final day before our flight. But OMG... the weather that day was 112F. HOW IS THAT POSSIBLE!? The rest of our trip wasn't like that because the canyons are cooler. 

In Phoenix, we were able to do ""famous"" BBQ and a stop at a ""trendy"" coffee shop, and then I said ""Okay, done! No more. Bye Phoenix!"" 

We spent 5 full hours at the USO because of the heat. 

This place is before the security line and you'll have to use the public bathroom before going in. They don't have their own. 

Five hours is a lot, but honestly this place was soooo great I didn't mind. They have everything!!! Lockers for your luggage, greeting cards, food, drinks, a cafe, a relaxation room with recliners (where I spent 95% of my time!), huge gaming room, library, internet cafe, and a baby room. EVERYTHING!!! 

This place was really busy, but it was so comfy I was still able to take a nap in the relaxation room. The relaxation room is darker than the rest of the USO. There's still a little light that filters in for safety though. It has a huge TV with DirecTV channels which I used to watch Captain America movies (how fitting!) and Friends. The recliners have sockets so you can charge your phone. 

There were a lot of food choices!!! Fresh baked dessert items (cookies, muffins, brownies!), microwavable dinners, turkey sandwiches and other kinds of sandwiches, yogurt.... MOVIE THEATER STYLE CANDY AND CHOCOLATE... AGAIN... EVERYTHING!

This place is really great. Definitely a great amenity for our military at a super busy international airport. Thanks hubby bubby!",2019-08-10 13:39:29,False,0.08145658692647487

Make sure to have your ID ready for a speedy check in!  They're great and always have TONS of toiletries for members to have.  Last time I came here, I left with a travel pillow, blanket, and a hygiene kit--that doesn't even touch the dozens of snacks I was offered!  The volunteers here are really nice, several of which were veterans and even spouses of veterans.  People I've met here and the stories I've been blessed to share here are all memories I am so grateful to have.

All in all, this has got to be one of the nicest USO facilities I've had the fortune of experiencing.  I reduced the rating to 4 star just because of the hours.  Part of the best things about USO facilities is having a place to rest at for late night flights, but their hours are Sunday to Saturday 8am to 8pm.  They try their best to open 24 hours on holidays, but it gets difficult without the manpower unfortunately.  Again, I genuinely appreciate all that USO does and this is the fanciest USO I've been to, but the hours of operation is the downer (when compared to other USOs).

Tip: hours are Sunday-Saturday 8am to 8pm!  They try their best to open 24 hours on holidays, but there's no guarantee, so call ahead if you are planning on coming here off hours!  They're great about picking up the phone!

The young lady that did my nails was very pleasant and friendly.  She was pretty quick and did a good job.  The only difference was  the previous salon trimmed my cuticles, which I think needs to be done on any manicure, and they seemed to be a little more meticulous about evening up the edges with the buffer on the nails, but  I was  happy with the end result.

Then, even though there were people waiting, a handful of employees left. They even asked one of the men to get the pedicure chair ready for me and he instead left, so I didn't sit down for 15 more mins. 

Then the chair they put me in didn't work so I had to hold my leg straight in front of me the whole time, which was really uncomfortable. There were other chairs open and when I asked if every other chair worked.. the guy laughed and said ""yes, it's just this one"". Why would you put someone 5'1'' in the one chair that doesn't move?

The water jet was also spraying all over the floor, there was someone else's open water bottle next to me the whole time (but they didn't bring me a water or clean up that one). They didn't change the towel on the manicure table so someone's nail clippings were still all over it.

The worst part for me though was the outcome - two nails were cut on a diagonal (irreparably until they grow back), and I wasn't asked what shape I wanted my nails to be.

This was the dirtiest experience I've ever had at a nail salon and my nails look terrible.

The only reason I'm giving two stars (v. 1)  is because I shared the feedback with the owner at the time who seemed genuinely disappointed.

Two foot tubs were prepped and filled with water. Husband was attended to while I waited with feet in the tub for about 15 minutes until the other nail tech finished with her client. Appreciated that they warmed up the water while I was waiting. At least I was able to make use of the message chair all that time. I did feel for my husband as his pedi was a bit painful at times. The nail tech was very apologetic but it was not a relaxing or enjoyable pedi for him.

After all that time having my feet submerged in the water, I was attended to and the pedi was done quickly. By this time there were customers waiting and only two nail techs working the floor. I understood. The nail tech left some edges unpainted but at this point I did not want to pull her away from her customer.

ABOUT THE SPACE
There is a wall that showcases a large variety of nail colors from various name brands. Many looked old and low on polish. I usually like to see fresh and new nail polish bottles, especially new in-season options. 

Message chairs are nice and looked worn in. They do the job. There is a small flat screen across from that area that you can watch during your pedi service. 

FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall, the salon itself is very spacious, bright, and fairly clean. Not very zen-like colors on the walls or any decor to soften lines or to instill a cozy feel. Nail techs were friendly. Pricing is fair. Good for those looking for affordable nail services with no frills and thrills offered at spa nail salons. I did read they offer a free cocktail with a service on Monday - Thursday between certain hours. This is a fairly new business and a nice add in the Mint Hill area.

Let's start with the 3.5 hour set up. I had a compatible modem that worked with spectrum. The tech could not get it to work(hmm.) so I had to go with their modem that charges a monthly fee. But was told if I got my own I could send theirs back and have the 10$ fee prorated and send it back via  ups. Well I know shit does not work like that unless you have tight customer service and billing systems that work properly. I have work in IT and completely understand  how this shit works.

SO I purchase another modem that is compatible with WOW set it up and call their customer service to have the MAC  address enabled and ask for a rlbox to send their modem back. WOW advises me I can use the box it came in and go to a UPS STORE AND return it free. Hmm. You see how this is going.  I do so and return it.  3 days later my internet service is not working and I isolated it to the modem. I call WOW Land their tech support tells me they are having a major system issue and they can not log my ticket and that I need to schedule a visit  for a tech because  my service is broken, how ever he can not note my account because of their system issue and I should call back. I know this is BS because a company with any integrity would make a paper copy and enter it into the system. The next day I call back to schedule my appointment and a tech tells me to wait a minute and asks for My MAC again and my service mysteriously start to wok again. WOW amazing. LET'S skip 45 days and I receive a bill for 135$ for internet that should cost 39.99 a month. 25$ for returning the modem, 10 $ x 2 month for renting their modem, 10 late fee for not paying my bill in advance. So I call customer support and after an hour I have the fees removed, it was an interigation from someone who for sure does not speak English as a 1st language. After all that I ask to pay my bill. The rep then tells me that I have to use an automated system unless I want to pay 5$ for her to process it. I ask well will your IVR system know you have made adjustments to my account, she of course lets me know of course. I let her know I understand how billing systems work and do not believe her. She assures me this is not the case. So she put me into the IVR system and low and behold I the account credits are not honored. I call back an have to deal with the same shit for another 30 minute while not being assured that the modem rental fee has been remove even though I was charged 25$ for returning by UPS. Yeah this is a company that provides shit service. Oh Adan who was my second customer service rep assured me I could cancel with out fees if I am once again charged a service fee for the modem I was charge 25$ for returning via UPS.",2019-03-09 05:49:35,False,0.11124079115346547

PARKING
Metered parking can be a nightmare at this Bayview location.  

Located on the west side of Bayview, but close enough to Millwood lights to the south that you can park on either side.

FOOD
They sell Western brand cream cheese to go or you can choose from around a dozen really interesting, traditional and non-traditional flavours of cream cheese they blend.  It's cute because they decorate the top of each flavour.

They have a phyllo ""spinach feta spiral"" that is garlicky and tasty.  It is better if it is warmed up, which they offer to do.

They sell a few flavours of rugelach, but I haven't had them.

Their bagel flavours are pretty traditional: cinnamon-raisin, poppy, sesame, everything.  They have a wonderful chew.  They are not the massive oversized bagels.  I wish they had a sprinkling of salt for their seed options to compensate for the lack of salt that is in traditional Montreal bagel dough, but I still enjoy them immensely anyways.

I love that they never seem to run out of flavours.  I'm guessing they bake bagels all day/night like the Avenue Rd location???

DRINKS
They have some bottled brand name smoothies and juices.

SEATING
Next to none.  Maybe 3 seats if I am recalling correctly.

STAFF
Prompt and friendly.  Though hard to see staff over the tall display cases; I use my imagination and envision a giant claw machine at the arcade that fetches a plush toy after I put in a Loonie then they appear at the cash register with my haul.

Usually when they fill up your paper bag with fresh-from-the-wood-oven bagels, they are still warm. It will fill your car/kitchen with the most delectable aroma!

My favourite is the everything bagel followed by the whole wheat with sesame seeds (my SO loves the ""big bagel twisters"" and the poppy seed). 

They also do sandwiches of all sorts, and they have many house specialties like danishes, latkes, rugulas and knishes (mmm try the spinach knish warmed up).

They are located in a small industrial plaza on Brimley, north of Sheppard. They have seating for less than 20 diners, with most of their business being takeout and catering. Looking past the service counter reveals a huge kitchen plus another area where they smoke the foods. The back of house space looks to be easily four to five times large than the front of house.

What makes this place different from most Jamaican/Caribbean restaurants is their claim to offer healthier choices. To support this claim, they make all their own seasonings, with a lower salt content and all natural ingredients. Their marinades are bottled and available for purchase at the counter. They use chickens that are grain fed and locally grown.

Their daily menu offers Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, BBQ Chicken, Stew Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Fish. The fish has to be ordered two hours in advance. Weekly specials include a different soup every day, Curry Goat on Wednesdays, Cow Foot on Thursdays, and Oxtail on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays only.

My companion and I ordered small plates of Jerk Pork, Oxtail, and Stew Chicken in order to sample a few dishes. They were all served with Rice & Peas and a Veggie Medley (steamed).

Our plates arrived with generous portions of rice & peas and veggies and a decent amount of proteins (for small orders).

The jerk pork looked good, with a nice smoke ring around the edges. It tasted okay but it was dry and the seasoning hadn't penetrated the meat as much as the smoke. They probably used a leaner, ""healthier"" cut of meat instead of a more marbled (fattier) cut. Some gravy would have probably improved this dish (for me).

The stew chicken, with an ample amount of gravy, was also okay and appeared to be all skinless dark meat.

The oxtail was our favourite dish. It was the most flavourful of the three and tender enough to come off the bone easily.

Overall, I admire their efforts to offer healthier cooking but I would have to describe the taste as average. I've had better and I've had worse but I don't know if I've had healthier (from a Caribbean restaurant). The service was friendly.",2019-05-19 16:27:10,False,0.11246992711122844

I personally crave a nice big serving of oxtail with rice & peas often and now I can have it with less guilt.  Same goes poutine.  Plus, you gotta love the warm and enthusiastic vibe of the people who work here.  

Though not on their regular menu (yet), they serve a mean poutine.  Like I said, it's more of a guilt-free type poutine with fresh cut fries, fried in coconut oil.  I personally only use coconut oil when I cook so I was excited about this.  The fries was then topped with some oxtail gravy, mixed veggies (yes, veggies!) and cheese.  The cheese wasn't your regular cheese curds, which I personally prefer (if you've read my other reviews, you'd know of my love of dem squeaky cheese).  Though the cheese added some nice saltiness to the poutine, it didn't melt well in the middle of the meal.  Was basically a blob of hardened warm cheese. Was like eating some Saganaki but on the tougher, chewier side. Perhaps they should have at least shredded the cheese while spreading it more throughout the layers of fries instead of just on top? The mixed veggies which entailed rapini, onions and bell pepper, were also a nice topping.  Gave a nice crunch and added a unique flavour. Though I'm not a huge fan of rapini due to its bitterness, the other vegetables helped contrast the flavour so it was really good.  Was so good that I ate it all.  

As for the oxtail gravy, I wish it were a little more on the thicker side.  With its runnier texture, the fries became a little too soggy.  I did also order oxtail with rice to-go and the oxtail was delicious.  Again, I wish the sauce/gravy was thicker, but it was still flavourful.  Personally, I love having the sauce/gravy on its own while dipping some fresh fried dumplings (which they unfortunately do not have. Or maybe not yet).  

I definitely love the idea of having healthier alternatives to classic Jamaican dishes, so I'm definitely going back to this place to try their other menu items.",2017-09-03 00:32:12,True,0.06979856916667776

I had the ribs, risotto balls, salami, artichoke, a variety of cheeses and more. It was all very flavourful and tasty.

Next we tried a variety of dishes such as the squash ravioli, squid ink pasta, ricotta stuffed 'domes', hanger steak and rapini, the sea bream and a cannoli for dessert.

I throughly enjoyed every single dish. The butternut squash ravioli was on the sweet side but it mixed really well with the brown butter and walnuts. The ricotta cheese and mushrooms was light and fluffy, but not too heavy. The ink squid pasta was good, but can be an acquired taste because of the momba hot sauce. 

The hanger steak and rapini was delicious and cooked via sous-vide to perfection. The sea bream was good as well - and the pea purée was the really winner because the fish had a very clean taste.

The service was really good and attentive. The chefs explained each dish in detail and how they prepared it, which elevated the experience even more.

The decor of the place is quite clean and simple and I think they have the other locations in downtown but I have never tried so I decided to give it a try..

I ordered three dishes:

Caesar salad - it's really good and flavourful, it's one of best Caesar salad I have tried! When asking the waiter for the secret :), I was told they use mussel instead of bacon bit, therefore it's different. I really like it but abit small for the price though

Mussel- overall, the taste is typical mussel with tomato like broth, it's quite but I guess the mussel is not in season, the mussel meat is abit small comparing to the shell it is in. 

Bowtie pasta - I like the nutty flavour of this dish and quite light! It is quite good 

Overall, the food quality is good and worth 4 stars but I think it's abit pricey given the portion. Also, maybe it was still in grand opening week, the service is also abit slow so therefore I give about 3.5 stars!",2018-10-07 03:12:46,True,0.08533769533769693
NQlVbbwIxAEpe9XKZ6gDXQ,wDTTlq_DX1NdOQ0Qi6RJIA,_5jxYOsRPh3GDA7vzu2mZw,5.0,3,0,0,"Nestled within Upper Canada Mall's Market & Co. you will find Amano Kitchen, an open-concept Italian restaurant sourcing the freshest local ingredients.  A spin off from their popular Union Station location, Amano Kitchen is open to satisfy your lunch, dinner, or take out needs. 

When you try a new restaurant, you have two choices, cautiously sample the menu or jump in with both feet.  I decided to do that later and ""Let Us (Amano) Cook for You"". For $49pp, the concept of this four course open menu is quite simple.  THE CHEFS CHOICE, and you will literally not know what you will get from the menu and was described as literally what the chef is in the mood to dish up - are they bored of serving up beef, lets consider Sea Bass this time.  

The four courses include: a charcuterie board; a pasta dish; main entree, and desert.  

To be safe, the waiter asked if there were any definite no go's on the menu or allergies.  After all, what would be more of a disappointment then being served something you would not order unless you were starving, and even then -- choosing not to eat.  

I am not going to go into every dish, after all, part of the experience is enjoying the food for yourself.  However, here is what I am going to add about Amano.

Without a doubt, this has to have been one of my most satisfying dining experiences in recent memory and worth checking out. The food is fresh, flavourful, and inviting with a fair portion size. Most times I have visited an italian resturant I ask myself why I didn't bother just throwing pasta in a pot at home and binging netflix.  This is nothing against Italian food - however, rarely an experience to talk about. In the case of Amano, WOW factors came to mind, with the blending of flavours and ingredients.  The pasta was fresh, the menu (I wish I had grabbed a photo) had something for everyone.  Spoiler: They make amazing, melt in you mount Pork Belly.  Amano had a nice wine list, and some signature italian sodas to round off the menu.

I had only two criticisms from my Let Us Cook for You menu.  One, the charcuterie board featured a healthy dose of Pork Belly; which was duplicated as a main entree, as well as they made Pork Belly, it was a bit of a disappointment considering the all of the options available on the menu.  It is also the least expensive entree item, humm.  Secondly, as much as the meal was designed as a sharing experience they skimped on the desert and only brought on strawberry cheese cake, made with fresh Ontario berries, to share. Although, to their credit - in recognizing our disappointment, a second dessert arrived with our latte order (a tasty Panna cotta topped with lemon pudding and blackberries).

The restaurant, only open a few weeks now is new, fresh and inviting.  Seating ranges from bar like seating against the open concept kitchen (equipped with mobile charging plugs), cozy tables and larger high tabels for groups or less inimitate encounters. The only downfall, is that they are limited to Mall Hours so if you want to have a relaxed meal be sure to get there early.

Over all, a great experience and I will be back to try their Sea Bass entree and to explore their take out menu / items.",2018-10-04 14:23:15,True,1

My friends and I came here during lunch hour on a weekday after attending court nearby. It was a bright and sunny afternoon but the inside of the restaurant was very dimmed and empty. We decided to give it a try anyways because we were craving wings, despite the fact that there's so many more delicious restaurants in North York. The service was extremely slow.. There were 2 waitresses working on the floor but neither one of them addressed our table. We waited an extremely long time just to place an order, and then to wait for our food, and finally to request for the bill. There was just nobody available to serve our table when the restaurant was empty. 

The food was meh, I mean I'm not really expecting much out of wings to begin with. The aggravating part was the drinks were really flat (when they're supposed to be carbonated), and were just slightly colder than room temperature, ew. 

Everything about this location just seems bleh. It's crazy to think this is a popular wings restaurant at an extremely busy location filled with amazing eateries and night life. I can't even say the service was terrible because it was non-existent. And I'm pretty sure nobody likes a flat coke/gingerale.

We called the location and informed them of the error. The staff member who answered the phone stated that they were not allowed to remake the food, as they were not allowed. As well, there was no way the food would be delivered. Not a sliver of understanding of the situation, empathy, or a desire to give a hint of customer service. When it was clear that nothing was going to be done to try and rectify the problem, we demanded a refund for the missing item. The staff members response, immediately hang up without another word.

So I had to call back, but low and behold, my calls went unanswered. I used another phone, and within two rings, wouldn't you know it, the same woman picked up!

I had asked immediately to speak to the on shift manager. I was told the manager was not in the store, and wouldn't be back for 30 minutes. This is at 630pm on a Saturday; I highly doubt that was the case. I asked who then was in charge, to which she stated that she was. I then had to take over being a manager and explain the basics of customer service to her. Such as showing empathy to someone's situation, offer solutions, such as a refund, and to not hang up on someone when they are asking for help and are not happy with what is being done. 

She stated that she did not hang up abruptly and that she was hung up on. I asked her if she said good bye, or if I had said goodbye. Silence was my only response. I asked again, and she finally replied that she thought the conversation was over after the refund was requested. That's fine, but you don't then hang up on someone and walk away. That might be how she conducts her personal life, but you don't do that at work. 

Finally an apology was offered and I was told that her manager, who is unavailable for 30 minutes, has processed the refund. Not sure how that was possible that the manager was around to process a refund, then disappear during a Saturday dinner rush, as the time between the initial phone call and the follow up was mere minutes. This manager should have a disappearing act as an illusionist. I took the apology and stated that how she conducts herself was far from appreciated.

The service at this location is down right disgusting!  Clearly the bartender/server working here has not been trained nor does she grasp the concept of ""hospitality"".

I made a 2nd visit when I should have learned from my first experience and now fully regret it.  Upon my visit, I asked for the Sunday special which included a pitcher of beer (60 oz.), 2 lbs of wings, fries and carrots/celery.  As she started pouring the pitcher, I asked for it to be served in a pint glass since the majority of bars I have gone to will NOT serve a pitcher to one person but instead follow the 24 oz maximum serving size rule.  Upon my request, she was happy to comply and it was my assumption that she would have given me the Pint #2 and Pint #3 as I finished the preceding Pint.  Instead, she shockingly dropped all 3 Pints in front of me which was very odd.  I asked her to place the other 2 pints in the fridge for me.  She did this!

A friend of mine arrived within 10 minutes and we moved to a table next to the bar.  Within a minute of us sitting down, the bartender/server appears with one of my beers (Coors Light) and hands it to my friend.  My friend gives me a puzzled look since he does not drink light beer nor did he get a chance to order his beer.

After waiting 15 minutes to get our food order, we decided that the service was beyond ridiculous.  There was only 1 individual at the bar and a table with 3 people in the entire restaurant.  She spent the majority of her time behind the bar chatting with the customer and not doing her job.

We did not finish our beers and my 3rd beer remained int he fridge.  I asked for the bill and she charged me for the entire pitcher.  In return I left no tip.

There was about 12 tables that seats a maximum of 4 each, and 4 bar seats. There is a patio that opens up in May, that has about 5 tables that seats 2 each.

The bathroom in the basement will only fit those who are below 6'2, so that's a little inconvenient. 

The servers were decent in attention and speed.

They were also able to easily separate bills, that's a plus for some groups.

A bar setting, great for beer and of course wings.  Loved that there are several large screen TV's with a few sports channels on.  It's not a very big place but there is also a patio for summer gatherings.

SERVICE
Was good.  Our server checked-in with us often enough.  Good energy and quick to respond to all of our requests.

FOOD
I only had the wings and there good.  The wing menu was organized by flavour-base:  honeys, bbqs, exotics, etc.  I had the awesome honey.  Yum.  I tried another flavour, sweet escape, yum!

We were trying to decide if we wanted to take advantage of the buy one get one half of apps during happy hour with one drink purchase. So we decided to get a Gar Par fries and calamari for apps. The gar par fries were a bit small with very little sauce. The fries were crispy but taste weird inside, not fully cooked?!? The calamari appeared big but then I realized they cut the calamari very small and cooked them with lots of batter to look bigger. 

We also ordered three pounds of wings with the gar par and spicy flavour, honey garlic as gar par and dry Cajun. The only one that seemed good was the Cajun which had lots of spice and flavour. The spicy gar par didn't have enough gar par and lots of spicy. The honey garlic gar par was just a weird combo and didn't compliment each other. Perhaps more gar par flavour would have helped cause all I tasted was the honey garlic and not enough saltiness.

I've heard and read mixed reviews about this place, but I decided to give it shot anyway (I normally don't go to new places with mixed reviews). There were a lot of stuff on the menu, probably close to 100 wing sauces that can satisfy every palate. The boyfriend and I went for the sample platter (20 pieces + veggie sticks = $24.99) because we're very indecisive (or greedy? ha!) couple. We went for the safe Hot Honey (my favorite kind at St. Louis), and tried 3 new flavors: Desperado (Buffalo Medium & Maple), Farmer's Daughter (BBQ, Medium, Wild Jerk), and Gar Par (Caesar & Parmesan). 

1. Hot Honey - more like Buffalo and Honey, which is not a big stretch from the Desperado. Was quite disappointed but edible nonetheless.

2. Desperado - couldn't taste the Maple. Pure Buffalo imo.

3. Farmer's Daugther - I think this is a confusing mix. Buffalo and Wild Jerk are strong flavors, so they don't mix well together (no dominant flavor). The boyfriend hated the smell of this one, so I ended up finishing this batch :p

4. Gar Par - it's like eating regular wings with caesar salad dressing. If that's your cup of tea, then go for it. I found it odd and too creamy for my taste buds.

Unlike St. Louis, the wing order doesn't come with fries. We had to order a side of fries. We ordered the Naked Fries ($4.99) and they came out like McCain's fries. DISAPPOINTING.

And don't worry about the heat level. The 4-flame one didn't hurt my tongue at all.

Our tab came out to be $36 (incl. tip and we didn't order drinks). I say it's quite pricey. On top of that, I got a serious case of stomachache right after lunch. My advice is don't go for the sample platter. The combination of 4 sauces would just upset your stomach.

The number of times I've visited, the staff is SO THRILLED [she said with extreme sarcasm] to be working and serving their community. Being someone who has always enjoyed the food service and hospitality industry, I quite despise the lack of interest. 
I am well aware that the food service industry can be and is, very difficult. Depending on the restaurant, there are long hours, tough crowds, hard labor, regular turn over, and the list goes on. However, everyone has a choice on whether to accept a position in the industry or not. So, when my family and I visit on a VERY slow, Monday night, at least greet us with a genuine smile. Also, please remember that beverages in plastic cups with lids generally require straws. While I appreciate the table-side service; though it's expected when there is a table number provided, please do not show frustration when we did not grab straws from the counter on the way to picking our table. Especially, when my brother moved to collect the straws on his own instead of asking. Small things to fuss about but the hospitality industry requires a bit of genuine kindness and I did not feel that from many of the staff at this location. 
To top it off, our food was delivered in what we considered a timely manner, however, my wrap was more of a bundled fold. They use an extra large wheat wrap and leave plenty of room for the proper wrapping technique; however, I was just short of unbundling and re-wrapping it myself. Just to reiterate, if you have no interest in working in the hospitality industry, that's okay, it's not for everyone. 
I am not commonly one to express such distaste which is why I still provided this location, 3-stars, but I want to be sure that my point gets across. When you have a PRIME location that is within walking distance for SO many in our ever growing community, take pride in it. Make sure that the people supporting the business are showing the customers their best side. Everyone has an off day and this is a quick meal style place but that doesn't mean it should lack in quality of service.

We showed up around 6:00 on a recent weekday armed with a reservation, and were quickly shown to a cozy table near the back. (It might've been a little too cozy, as we were seated mere inches away from other diners.)

I quickly settled on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich (""brioche sesame seed bun, southern fried chicken breast, kale & swiss chard slaw, tomato, baby swiss cheese, mayonnaise"") as my entree, and I asked for onion rings as my side.

It was apparent right from the first bite that I was in trouble. The most obvious problem here is the sogginess of the sandwich, which, given the word ""crispy"" in the name of the concoction, was especially off-putting. There was absolutely no crunch to be had here, and that was what I was in the mood for (and wouldn't you be if you'd ordered a ""southern fried"" chicken sandwich?)

The rest of the 'wich didn't fare much better, as all the components were either offensively bland or way too soft. The lack of texture was pretty much disastrous, and I ultimately found that the sandwich reminded me a *lot* of the chicken burger at Burger King.

The onion rings fared even worse, if that's possible. They, too, were super soggy and without any deep-fried deliciousness, and the breading was tasteless and underwhelming. Also, the rings came with ketchup, which is just such an amateur mistake I don't even have the worse.

As I've never tried anything from Ace Hill before, I decided to try the Light brew. It was good but a bit too light; next time, I'll try the Vienna.

The food was amazing. We started off with the falafel platter which was served with their house made pita and a generous helping of hummus. The falafels were crispy and full of flavour and made for a great combination with everything on the plate. Next was the pepperoni pizza. You'd think it would be very simple but the dry aged pepperoni was what intrigued us. Fresh from the oven, the pizza was full of flavour and had a nice crunch to it. I love thin crust pizzas and was pleasantly surprised by the quality (they used a regular oven to bake it, not a brick oven). To end the meal, we ordered a tiramisu to share.

After that, he blow dried it and lightly went through my hair with a flat iron. Then he tells me to stand up so he can cut my hair.

My cut is always the same but I never have split ends and my cut always grows out well because of how he shakes it. I could probably go a few more weeks if it wasn't for needing my color to hide my grays ;).  My husband has also seen him for many years, and loves his work. 

I highly recommend Distinctive Salon and Spa, and specifically Joel Molenaar for color and cut.",2018-07-28 22:35:06,False,0.1257876929726844

My hair is stupid and weird, as I'm sure most people believe their hair to be, so it's always been a challenge to find someone who can give me a flattering and relatively modern cut that I like. Of course I turned to Yelp to try to find something close to home only to be disappointed with my first attempt at another close by salon. It left me very gun shy and I didn't cut my hair for over 6 months.

I took a chance on this place because it's an Aveda salon and I have had great luck with them in the past. The reservation system was a little unclear, I wasn't sure if I was really booked for the time I reserved. But I called to confirm, and it was on! I was booked with Joel. I was still nervous at that point but I just needed a cut so badly.

I was greeted by a lovely woman whose name I didn't catch, but she made me feel welcome immediately and asked if I wanted anything to drink. She then let Joel know I was there and he came out to greet me, totally friendly and gregarious. From there, just a great experience. I prefer to home dye and sometimes I get some shaming from stylists but not a sign of that from Joel. He listened to what I wanted and the problems I had with my hair and verified how much I was willing to cut off. A fabulous scalp massage, friendly conversation, and a fantastic cut and style followed! And even though I was the last customer on a Friday night, he took his time and did not seem to feel rushed at all.

I'm so relieved that I finally found a great place and so close to home. Thanks Joel and everyone at Distinctive!",2017-09-16 18:25:23,False,0.12089797226568406

I really enjoyed the shampoo time. She put a nice hot towel around my neck while letting conditioner soak in and massaged my hands (and arms).  I was totally relaxed in the shampoo chair.

We talked about how I want for my hair cut and she asked some questions and made some suggestions how to make my hair look the best possible.  She is a true professional hair stylist and she knows what she is doing.  

While she was working on my hair, I kept watching other stylists work through the reflection on the mirror.  All of them had perfectly styled hair, especially one had nicely curled hair. I wondered how long it takes to do her hair every morning with curling iron... It shows they have time (or make time) to do their hair right, and they take time to take care of their clients hair too.

I also consulted with her about possibly start coloring to hide my ever growing grey hair as I am not getting younger.  She took time to explain what color will give what impression and how they make my face look.  She was so patient with me and explained everything I ever wanted to know about hair coloring.

Examples:  I am a quilter and typically we starch all fabric before we cut into it so we need to buy starch. I can buy a large can here for a buck and would pay more at a local grocery chain. Granted it's hit and miss if they have the product on the shelf, but it's worth a try. Second, have you priced gift bags lately? I hate spending more than $4 on a PAPER BAG that practically every store charges. Not here! Often for the smaller bags, they are packaged in sets of two --- you get two bags for a buck. You really can't beat the price. Larger bags are still a dollar. Last, I get dental floss here. Again, you can't beat the price and in my opinion floss is floss. I have good dental check-ups so I think I'm good with their floss. 

This morning I went in to quickly get some craft supplies and the store already had about a half dozen patrons shopping.

They still have great colours and a comfy location, the only reason it's a 4 stars is because they still start the nail polish application too far from my cuticle and because application isn't always smooth. I guess that's because I choose their least picked colours so the bottles aren't as fresh.

The lady had a different technique than I was used to. She filled my nails shorter instead of cutting them and she adds more powder (nail cocaine) right away and then files it off with her tools. 

Here they have a cute little tray with all the tools they need to do the refill and a separate little tub for the different ends they need for the nail gun.

The lady who did my nails was nice enough, she did chat a lot with her friends in a different language which is ok but I like talking to people as my nails get done, so it would have been nice to be included in the conversation. She did ask me a few questions (where am i from? etc...) so i wasn't completely useless but still would've liked to be included. 

It's a very nice location. They have little towels to dry your hands after you clean them, it's well lit, comfy-ish chairs, and they have amazing colours! First time I had trouble choosing.

The only thing I didn't like was they painted further from my cuticles and so I'll have to get a refill sooner because they didn't paint all the way to the end. You can see my nail growth.

Cute nail salon, conveniently located near the metro & some shopping. I dropped in with 2 guy friends and they were able to accommodate all of us at the same time within 5 minutes (just long enough to pick nail polish colours!). The space is bright and airy with a chandelier. 

The owners are Vietnamese. Like most nail salons, the staff mostly just talk to each other in Vietnamese (I always wonder what they're saying! ""omg, look at this girl's calluses!""), although they were very friendly, asking us where we were from/what we were doing in Montreal, etc. I think it's a family-run business, because the guy who did my nails was really young. Also, this was the first time I've had my nails done by a dude! He was very meticulous and did a good job, although the salon got really busy and there were lots of people waiting by the time I left. I think he felt rushed during my manicure and the polish ended up with tiny air bubbles (this has happened to me before, and sometimes it depends on the particular polish but usually I notice it when they put the 2nd coat on too fast). I also smudged one of my nails while taking out my wallet. He fixed it with an extra coat, but it still ended up uneven. When you're getting a pedicure, you get to sit in a big massage chair and watch TV. The foot massage was nice, although they use this strange blue gel product instead of the usual foot cream. 

Colour selection was just okay. They had all the crazy and trendy colours (blues, yellows, greens, etc.) but relatively few pinks, corals, and reds. They carry mostly OPI. They also do shellac. 

Overall, fast and friendly. But I wasn't totally satisfied with the results. NB: Cash Only (there is an ATM in the salon).",2011-08-05 04:55:52,True,1

In a city dominated by smoked meat (which I also like, just to make it clear), I cannot even begin to tell you how much better my life has become since I ran into this place on Yelp.

Hands down, the best fried chicken in Montréal. Also to add to that resume, I'd say almost inarguably the best fries in Montréal. Guys, just listen. Those fries stay crispy even when left out cold. HOW DO THEY DO THAT? The fries are so good, the fries are so good, the fries are so good. 

The fried chicken is also really delicious. Both the leg/wing and the breast: oh god, flavour right down to the bone. And the chicken nuggets. UNREAL. These are nothing like McDonalds nuggets. These are pieces of real chicken deep fried to create the same crust as your regular fried chicken. So good.

They also have chicken poutine using fried chicken. Need I say more?

Normally Poulet Bronze is my go to place for late night fried chicken. $2.25/piece for a very spicy and crispy coating is nothing to sneeze at, especially when it is delivered to your door after 11 pm.

However, last night they screwed up right royally and I am questioning my need for fried chicken in a city that knows how to do steak tartare, foie gras croissants better than anyplace else this (or that) side of the Mississippi...

In short, half the order was forgotten. No one said ""sorry."" When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he wasn't in. When I asked that the manager call me, I was told he would, but he didn't. And then on top of it the delivery guy/driver yelled at me when he returned (an hour later) with the forgotten half, because he had not been trained properly to check that he was taking everything on that was written on the bill.

They opened a second location in ville Saint Laurent, and the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that like East Side Mario's, Madison's Barr + Grill, and other wannabe American restaurants they belong there and not downtown in Montreal.

Perhaps, if I am racked up in a hospital and unable to do anything other than blink my eyes in order to communicate, I might reconsider ordering from them, but only because Poulet Bronze is 12 letters long and Dinette Triple Crown is 18 letters long. But ultimately I think it comes down to a question of respect. And nothing shows how much a restaurant respects a client as when the delivery guy yells at you in the hall and the manager can't even be bothered to say ""I'm sorry.""

And finally, as I alluded to earlier, there is so much good food that is native to Montreal, I'm not quite convinced anymore for the need to deal with what could only be considered average food imported from elsewhere.",2013-09-16 23:04:08,False,0.1416513071820159

The minuses:  Chicken pieces were quite small and the coating was average tasting at best.  Sadly, I came here to indulge in fried chicken so my experience was a disappointment.

Well they just finished. They were right on with the time did not try to sell me anything over or beyond what talked about in the quote.things that stood out to me about using them was they are licensed bonded and insuredThey came in a truck with their logo on the side the technician was in a uniform he called prior to showing up.

While most Dollarama's retain the same visual identity and selection of products, this is a much weaker offering from the company. You know something's wrong when you walk in and are greeted by a sign warning you to watch your head when you walk down the stairs.

This location is cramped, underwhelming and feels very small. The Dollarama at Square One Shopping Centre spanks this - much bigger, much cleaner, with wider aisles and friendlier service, despite also being sub-ground level. I honestly thought I was in a different chain altogether when I went into the Spadina/Adelaide location.

I went in here looking for a couple of specific items, and was greeted by overstocked shelves, dumpy-looking presentation and visitors who looked like they'd rather be somewhere else. Everyone was rushing through the place knocking things around, and I decided that I didn't have the patience to bother any further with this.

They are always so on the ball with upcoming events, are readily stocked with new decorations for either valentines day, halloween, christmas - you name it, they are ready to sell it weeks in advance. It sure beats buying expensive stuff at a department store if it's a one-time use.

I have to say that this place is best for GUM.

Bocado has somehow managed to find the skinniest birds I've ever seen and their flavor wasn't even that great.

Watch out for alcohol prices though, they are not shown anywhere and when we asked for a wine menu the owner asked us to ""try something""... it was a very plain douro, half a glass each and when the bill came ....OUCH ! $17 per Glass, Clearly we were duped. 

Food is good (well the chicken is), they have a blackboard with meal of the day and we were disappointed with that, chicken is what they do best. Above all I  suggest, asking for Prices on anything not on the menu. 

Poulet Excellent, ambiance cosy mais faites attention aux prix du vin qui n'est pas affiche. On a eu une surprise au moment de la facture de constater que notre verre de vin (mal rempli) coutais plus que la nourriture au complet.",2017-06-09 10:25:04,False,0.057196002765540044

We started with the sardine appetizer: 2 whole Portuguese sardines on top of lovely grilled toast (crouton or crostini) with lemon, garlic and Portuguese olive oil.  Very yummy and different than you'd get from Italian sardines.  
For main course, my wife had half a roasted chicken (smaller than typical chicken, but still too big for my wife especially after the sardine) with a fabulous sauce (piri piri?).  It was served with a fresh, lovely salad made with what was called frissee, but was like the best leaf lettuce, olives, pickled red onions, and fried capers (my wife hates capers but loved these).  Additionally, there were transcendent, well-browned french fries with a lovely house made mayonnaise.  We were offered a spicier piri piri (?) sauce which was yummy.
I had the lamb chops on vegetables.  I'm not always a big fan of veggies, but loved these even more than the excellently cooked and spiced lamb. There was bitter notes from broccoli rabe, swish notes from carrots or some other root vegetables, petite white potatoes, and green beans sauteed to perfection and well browned.
We took home home pastelles natas for dessert: little custard filled pastries.  I was going to give the place 5 stars even if these were not good, but they were great.  The atmosphere is casual bistro with a big board containing all the menu items on the wall.  The owner was lovely, friendly, and very helpful.
Yeah, I liked it!",2016-09-13 05:24:04,False,0.06834695879735228

This is a small Portuguese grill with authentic, fresh, delicious food. I would have tried everything if I could, the food and menu, while unfamiliar to me, were explained by the owner, who let us come by for a quick lunch before the Eurocup finals game, Portugal vs. France. (Go, Portugal!) during which he had a large party of fans coming for a meal and to cheer on their team. (Go! Portugal!) Highly recommended!

I think there's seating for about 25 people max. It's a very tiny place, but well dispersed seating.
Another neat thing is they do delivery, so if you like their food they can bring it to your place.
All off the cooking is done directly before your eyes. If you are like myself you enjoy the show.
The menu is on a chalkboard in lovely colors and meals and daily specials vary. The pricing of the menu is approx 10$ for an appetizer and 20-30$ for a main course.
The food is all excellent. Good spices and well cooked. 
A great snack is their large fries and sauce for 6.90$ tax in. If only for those: I'd say stop by.
The only thing is the price versus what you're buying doesn't feel right at times. Now, a poutine is 18$+tax (even at places that have 60$ mains that would feel pricey).
Service is quick, attentive and bilingual (or better ;))",2015-12-22 15:29:00,False,0.08903609862117394

Il faut également appeler 45 minutes à l'avance pour commander le poulet avant d'aller le chercher. Mais ca vaut le détour et l'attente",2014-06-24 23:41:49,True,1
