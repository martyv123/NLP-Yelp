This is the type of store that once you walk in you can't walk out without finding something awesome to take home.  I would love for the owner to come to my house and decorate exactly as she has in this store.  It's a unique mix of home furnishings & wall hangings to Alex and Ani bracelets to specialty baby items like beautiful baby bags and clothing.  There are some really beautiful angel wings hanging on the wall.  So freaking awesome!  Today I found my bestie the cutest most comfortable pair of slippers.  When I say cute I am talking soft and cushiony with the most gorgeous fat ribbon bow on top with beautiful crystals adorning the bow. So unique and special.  I also picked up a few of their food items.  My mom loves scones so I got a box of scone mix and some specialty jam.  

This store is special because they offer things you can't find just anywhere.  They sell the little touches of comfort you place around your home to make it more personal.  Prices are very reasonable and the service here is great.  They make you feel like family!

Storefront is located in a strip mall next to a patio furniture store and a few other strip mall staples. Plenty of parking right out front. The store itself is relatively large for a bbq and smoker only brick and mortar retailer. I was there for rubs so didn't spend much time on the hardware side of the store, but many different product lines on display including Traeger Pellet Smokers, Big Green Eggs and a seemingly wide range of outdoor kitchen setups and components. 

As soon as I walked in was greeted by friendly staff and proceeded to the ""back wall"" of goodness. A pretty wide range of rubs including some of the big, ubiquitous brands to more unique and even local choices. They had a nearly full line of Lane's BBQ, a bunch of Caribeque and several local products. Some, based on how easily they can get the product in, are open and marked as samples - which made trying some (but not all unfortunately) of the rubs I'd been curious about super easy. I've not seen this before in the other BBQ/smoking stores i've been to. I wish more would take this practice on as it's a great way to determine if you want to try a small bottle of something new, or, maybe buy something else's you might not have considered. I bought Loot and Booty What's Your Beef rub after trying it from the sample. Had there not been a sample, I probably would have passed it over. I recognize this is an extra inventory cost and cleanup cost for the store, but I applaud that they are trying to do this as much as possible - well done and my end sale from this visit doubled thanks to your investment here.

Don't get me wrong--I enjoy this park, but there are some aspects that preclude me from awarding it a 4.  The main reason is that, as another reviewer mentioned, this park isn't the most conducive to pedestrians in the section between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge.  In that section, there is at least as much road as there is path, and if you're on foot or bike, you have to cross it at at least one point.  This section also isn't as scenic as it could be, due to the presence of the wharf (though I'm sure I'd appreciate that aspect of the park more if I had a boat).  Finally, the cool little section with the gazebo that Chelsea S. took a picture of is prone to flooding if the water level's high, which makes it unusable and less than picturesque.

Having said all of that, this park definitely has some redeeming factors.  First, as I already mentioned, the bike trail runs through it, which is great, and is definitely more scenic than it is on the other side of the river.  Second, the section down by South Side Works is quite nice, and offers a great view of the Mon.  Third, the park has picnic tables in both the sections between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge and at South Side Works, which make for a great opportunity to enjoy a picnic in view of the river.  Finally, the city seems to be working its way down this park from the Hot Metal Bridge installing improvements--the latest of which is a new marina next to South Side Works.  It's clear that they have a master plan for this park, and the improvements definitely have improved the park, as is evident in the South Side Works section.

Overall, this park provides some much needed green space in the South Side, and is a boon to its residents and cyclists enjoying the trails.  However, there's no comparison between it and the larger parks in the city, such as Frick and Schenley, or even Highland Park.  It'll be interesting to see how things shape up in the next couple of years, as the city continues to improve it.  3.5 stars.",2015-06-12 14:32:34,True,0.14840650820314188

Recently I was in the London Fog Cafe neighbourhood and so I dropped in since the reviews have been fabulous.  Took me a few turns to find it lol tucked in a strip mall by the London Drugs (yes I am directionally challenged).

The folks behind the counter were quite friendly as I ordered and babbled about everything and nothing happy to have someone other than kids to talk to.  A simple cappuccino and bakery treat were in order (I picked the peanut butter marshmallow bar).  Both were decent and the treat later shared with the kidlets with no complaints.

I liked all the cafe had to offer (lunch & breakfast items and a nice beverage selection.).  Immediately upon entering I noticed a very cozy & welcoming feel.

Where do I start? 

First of all, the service is EXCEPTIONAL. THE best service I have had in a coffee cafe EVER. Run by Len and Pat, this place feels like you're a part of the family. Len and Pat go out of their way to ensure your drink is EXACTLY the way you want it. I was being a total pain, but that didn't matter, when I got my drink, it was PERFECT. They custom- made me my very own 'Sapna G. London Fog' and daaamn, it was delicious!

Not only does London Fog Cafe carry teas, lattes, coffees and juices, but their food menu is unlike any I've ever seen at a coffee cafe. They have potato pancakes ($1 each!), nachos, cabbage rolls, sausage rolls, homemade baked goods that will have you salivating within seconds, sandwiches, omelettes, tarts, meatballs, Borscht, squares, and the list goes on and on.

The pricing is fantastic, the ambiance is inviting and the service, like I said, is the BEST in town.

If you're not already a regular, GET ON IT! Oh, and when you're there, makesure you tell Pat & Len that Sapna G. says 'Hi' ;)",2010-02-07 18:29:44,True,1

We did my youngest's communion celebration here. 

Sapore Antipasto was amazing. Fresh. Delicious.  And filling. 

The calamari are to DIE for. OMG you have got to order them. I only wish there was more in a plate. But that's because it is that good. 

Pastas are off the chart. I had linguine pescadora which is a seafood pasta dish. OMG it was succulent and cooked perfectly. Sauce was soooo good. 

We also ordered the ribeye steak.  They cooked it exactly how we ordered it. And wow wow wow. Sapore isn't known as a steakhouse but I will say they rival some steakhouses I have been to. They had this blueberry sauce they put o. The steak that I thought would taste bad. But my gosh. It actually worked so well. 

Seafood dish is also amazing. Salmon Scallops and Shrimp were grilled to perfection. And the grilled calamari in this dish proved they can cook calamari any way you want it. 

The pizza is fantastic as well. Make sure to ask for it to be cooked well done and you will get an authentic Italian pizza. 

Their house wine was only $28 a bottle. (Yes $28!!!). And it was such a good wine. Everyone loved it. 

Would I recommend this place? ABSOLUTELY!

Yesterday I needed to have a business meeting with someone important and we needed to be somewhere not loud so we can actually talk. So I decided to try Sapore. 

Grilled Calamari to start, garden salad as primo and main dish we shared a hot pizza 

Grilled calamari: THE BEST I ever tasted. Absolutely PERFECT!  If you ever go here you HAVE to try this appetizer. OMG SO GOOD. Just perfect

Salad: meh. Plain salad. Nothing exciting about it for $10

Pizza:  they have a wood oven so pizza usually tastes good from a wood oven. This place is no exception. The pizza was perfect. 

We didn't have wine... just two bottles of carbonated water and an espresso each with no dessert 

Total bill was $75 tax and tip included. 


For 1 appt, 2 salads and 1 pizza it's a bit steep but the environment is classy and service was OK so I was okay with it. 

So why only 3 stars you ask?

 Or ally I would have given the place 4 stars but... they had SO MANY fruit flies in the place that it kind of grossed me out. I kept killing them over and over again and they just kept coming. 

Maybe I attracted them with my after shave... or maybe they just liked my food... no matter though because they really did ruin the experience. 

And that's when I remembered that the last time I WA sphere I had the same thing happen. 

I mentioned it to the waiter and he said he hadn't noticed. He did apologize but didn't really acknowledge the issue that is clearly happening in this fine dining establishment.

Very disappointing, if it wasn't a busy new years eve night, I would have certainly returned the dish.  

As for the appetizers (salads and calamari) and entrees the portions were disappointingly small for the price.  The prices are not justifiable.  The quality and quantity are severely lacking.  

Often good service can compensate, though our server ""Shirley"" was lacking professionalism.  She did not give proper attention and likely did not submit our order properly as we waiting an excessive amount of time for our food considering the amount of people in the venue.  She was unpersonable and unsympathetic.  Even with only 4 guests she automatically included 15% tip on the bill, she probably had a good sense she wasn't probably deserving to get that if she wouldn't have done that.  

As for the venue, one positive is that it is beautiful place.  The decor, color scheme and presentation make for a comforting yet elegant restaurant environment.

Located in a somewhat desolate area of Woodbridge, this restaurant is a real gem of Italian food. Having to compete with many other Italian restaurants in the community, Sapore brings it up a notch with the high quality of their ingredients, attentive service, and rustic yet classy decor. I was here recently with my sister, and enjoyed the carpaccio di cervo and crostini di burrata to start; both were delicious. For my main dish I ordered the risotto ai porcini which was flavourful and cooked perfectly.

I recently had to travel to Las Vegas, for work, from out of state. During my trip, to LV, my chronic Diverticulitis decided to rear it's ugly head. By midday, I was in a considerable amount of pain. I called my G.I. Doc, back in my home state, to get a prescription sent over, for the usual antibiotics. Unfortunately, due to his medical license, he was unable to send the prescription, directly to an out of state pharmacy. He had the great idea, to send it to a Walgreens, near his office, then see if the LV location could transfer it. The LV Walgreens was indeed then able to transfer it, to their location, via their internal computer system.

I was in touch with Dave, in the LV pharmacy a few times by phone and he was just incredibly helpful. Very ""matter of fact"" and no-nonsense. My kind of guy, really. He never made me feel like I was making him go out of his way, or anything of the like. He was the one who initiated the transfer, told me when to head over, from the hotel, so I wouldn't get there after he closed for the night, etc.

After all this, the last thing I needed, was another problem, but... that was not to be, curse my luck. Unbeknownst to me, my most recent medical insurance card (which I DID have on me) DOES NOT have my prescription coverage information. (Separate card, now, apparently). Dave once again came to my rescue. He called my usual pharmacy, back home. Different company, completely. He was able to quickly get my current prescription coverage info, which they have on file. He then went over the meds with me, meticulously and made sure I understood all the ""do's and dont's"". I shook his hand and thanked him, profusely. He smiled and wished me all the best and his hopes that I started feeling better, soon. Just an all-around great man.

They were super friendly and so I did not worry about it at all. That's where three stars come from. 

The actual tattoo artist I was supposed to meet, however, was a shit show. Not only was she 15 minutes late, She completely ignored me when she walked in, not even asking who I was or who I might be waiting for. She came in and dropped off her stuff, then went back outside and brought in a drink of some sort for another person who seem to have an appointment with her at the same time. While she was chatting with this other person, she had two or three of the staff almost yelling at her and pointing at me explaining that I was a client and I have been waiting for quite a while. She looked very confused and sort of ignored me for a little while longer. Then she decided to check her phone, and finally came to sit with me. She stared at me blankly for what seemed like two minutes, before I explained that I was here because of the website and text messages from the day before. She didn't seem to know what I was talking about and asked me why I was there and what I needed. I explained I filled out a form on her website, and had been texting with somebody claiming to be her the day before, who confirmed an appointment for me at 3:30 the following day. She had no idea about the artwork descriptions or examples I had given online, nor did she seem very interested in what I had to say. She kept looking at the other client. Then she started blaming somebody she called her manager, and told me that she didn't have me on the schedule so she didn't have time. She then kept texting on her phone and started making phone calls, without really acknowledging what I might need. I finally picked up my bag and told her that if she and her manager wanted to get on the same page maybe they could give me a call and actually read the messages.",2019-09-14 18:27:39,False,0.07022367927059042

After the initial talk and exchange with my tattoo artist, Chris, he instructed me to set the tattoo over via PDF so that he could draw it up and have everything ready the day of. It has been over five years since I have had any ink and Chris made the process very easy and uneventful.

When Chris, the tattoo artist did the tattoo he was professional and explained everything to me setting me at ease. His demeanor was very calming and cool headed. I did not have any issues with the needle until the very end of the tattoo, and he paused based on my mannerism and asked if I needed a break. The tattoo turned out beautifully and and could not be happier with the honor that I will hear when I play it and hear is voice over the app. He also explained in detail making sure that I understood how to care for the tattoo afterwards.

There are a lot of great things about Springhill.  It has a convenient location, plenty of parking and modern rooms.  

I was very pleased with every step of our experience.  I called to get the room (so I could ensure room for the pack n plays) and the employee was very friendly.  She even checked various items (military status, aaa member etc) to get us the best rate.  Check in was quick and easy.  Our room was clean and well equipped.  In fact, there were bottles of baby shampoo on the counter with the other shampoos because they had noted the babies on our reservation.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. Extra towels were delivered quickly and every employee I encountered smiled and said hi.

Beds were comfortable and clean.  I slept on the pull out and was pleasantly surprised that it was even comfortable.

Breakfast was a nice feature.  There was a nice selection of both cold and hot selections. Dry cereal, bagels, bread and croissants along with yogurt.  Hot options included ham, sausage and scrambled eggs.  The breakfast staff was helpful pointing out a large table in the back that worked well for families.

We didn't use it, but there is a pool in the hotel as well.  

The one downside is that many of the rooms have a view of the turnpike toll gate.  The rooms must be well insulated because you heat very little noise from it.

smyLZjnDPhWTRJ_Iu7w0zQ,epAhbTwnVNXqFKwHDlgpBQ,_8RwgNjUPTQlr3_TKCd9vQ,5.0,2,0,0,"It can be difficult as a bride to find the ""one and only"" tailor right for you and the one dress you have. I noted the questions tailors I reached out to would ask, their price quotes, and recommendations. Linda left a positive impression with her prompt responses and honest input. Because Linda works from her house rather than at a facility where additional charges are incurred, she was also more affordable.

EXPERIENCE:
While I had these thoughts going in, Linda continued to surprise me. It was apparent that Linda was experienced and knew what was important. She asked me to bring my wedding shoes and encouraged me to sit, walk around, and move with the dress to make sure that where the dress hit would work for the day of during our second fitting. She also made adjustments as we went, requiring additional work on her end to make things just right.

CHANGES:
Linda was extremely detailed in explaining the changes that would be required with the dress; I had bought the dress one size too large (I just listened to what the wedding shop said). In addition to the mandatory shortening of the dress, she had to trim pieces of the top so that it didn't hit my neck awkwardly. She also brought in the back of the dress. All of this required removal and readdition of the lace afterwards. Linda helped to add cups with the dress and also bustled it, which I was told later can be a challenge with the layers of tulle. 

Linda was someone I could consult my ideas with and will not say ""yes"" to everything a bride wants. I liked this about her, because I asked for more poof to my dress, and she advised against it, explaining how the material of tulle with other material used to add poof could take away from the flow and delicacy of the dress. She was open to doing it if I wanted to, but her reasoning made me drop the idea, and I am glad I did.

CHANGES / BUSTLE:
I didn't realize Linda would end up adding clear buttons for the bustle. It threw me off to see them on my dress, and I admittedly became the stereotypical over-worried bride. I am happy to say that the Xpert knew what she was doing- it wasn't visible in any of the wedding pictures and I almost forgot I had worried unnecessarily about it. For brides who do want to be informed throughout the process I would advise asking to make sure expectations are in alignment. To emphasize, there was nothing negative about my experience, but knowing how brides can get, I'm just adding this as something to consider :)

The bustle was a little harder for my bridesmaids to do, likely due to the tulle material. Linda drew a diagram for my bridesmaids to follow and let me record her explaining how to do the bustle. She also advised that my bridesmaids practice the day before. Unfortunately, I wasn't insistent on this with my bridesmaids, who said it looked straightforward enough, so we ended up spending nearly an hour getting the bustle and were late to the reception (something for others to think about for their day of!)

COST:
Knowing the cost of tailoring my friends had gone through, the quoted price was much better than I was expecting, provided all of the changes. Linda was very transparent with the work she needed to complete, and the time that it would take given the changes. For brides with a budget, I would recommend going in with a set amount and idea, but knowing that if there are additional changes that you hadn't thought of, be flexible and understanding that something may need to give (perhaps not all of the recommended alterations can be done, for example). I felt it was reasonable and that Linda's expertise was certainly worth it.

COMMUNICATION / SCHEDULING:
When working with Linda, be sure to be clear of the dates and timelines. I erroneously thought we had a meeting a different day because she had suggested meeting in 3 weeks, and I may have accidentally marked a date, but didn't confirm this with her. Linda is very responsive through text, so there will not be a problem with going back and forth to plan logistics. It was also a plus that she was flexible and had later hours and weekends available.

TIMELINE:
Everyone's experience will be different; I ended up having 3 total trips.
- June 19: First trip for estimate and review of needed changes
- July 14: Second dress fitting; additional modifications to planned changes based on progress thus far
- July 20: Dress completed
- August 3: Dress picked up, bustling instructions shared

Linda treats you like a sister by the end of the journey. She is truly talented, and an artist in her own right, expressed through the beauty of her completed dresses.

The last thing you want is to worry about is your wedding dress not fitting right the day of, where thousands of dollars are already spent. With Linda, my dress looked beautiful the day of. I was comfortable and able to dance the night away with ease; my dress did not get caught once, even as I danced to Gangnam Style.

This place is best for groups of twos as their tables are rather narrow and the place is not too big. There was plenty of business as soon as the restaurant was open at 11 am and it was a third full by noon.

This place has a cute charm to it. They have lamented print of why you should eat fish as it is a rich source of Omega-3 and other vitamins.

I enjoyed my order of halibut and chips. The fries were long, sizeable and slightly crispy outside and super soft inside. They were neither skinny, burnt nor oily, too. The halibut had a thin batter and I could still taste the freshness of the actual fish.

Portions were rather generous. All orders come with a small side of either coleslaw or beets, which was surprising to me, since most of not all of the other (fish and chips) places that I have been to do not offer it alone as a side.

My friend did not know that the sizes would be as big and he was feeling rather hungry, so he made the mistake of ordering chicken nuggets and chips with another order of poutine. By the time, all of our food came, I asked him ""Are you sure you can eat all this? That is a lot of fries."" to which he responds ""Wow! I thought the poutine would just be snack size! Please definitely help me finish it.""

Well, I am not the biggest fan of gravy and I cannot handle cheese well, so I helped with ones that were not drenched in either or both.

Service : 3/5
Friendly enough service.  We visited during around early dinner 18:00 EST.  Only 1 other couple was in the dining area.

Food : 3/5
My wife opted for the the Halibut and Chips and Haddock and Chips for myself.  A bit more pricey than our go to spot at Painted Post Fish and Chips.  

We received our orders in about 10-15 minutes, as for the dishes themselves, the fries were done extra crispy just the way we like without us requesting to be cooked as such.  As for the ""fish"" both the haddock and the halibut were tender and fresh not mushy or soggy.  Each of us received 1 decently sized piece of fish for our orders.  Batter wise I'd have to say it was light and crispy, less greasy than we have tried at other fish n chip spots.  I'd rate the oiliness at 3/5** (view rating list below).  For the price paid, would have been nice to have a bit more fries included with the order (we love our fries when they aren't frozen!)

Condiments :
Ketchup in a squeeze bottle, not sure on the brand or quality.  They have something that resembles tartar sauce, but it had a pink/orange tinge to it, which was also in squeeze bottle.  However, something in the tartar sauce was making my tongue tingle to almost a numbing sensation, I had consumed more of their tartar sauce than my wife, so she didn't notice a similar sensation on her tongue.  Since I have no idea what was/is the cause of that odd tingly/numbing sensation, I would caution other foodies with sensitive tongues to go easy on the custom tartar sauce that is provided to customers.  Take out packs of tartar sauce are available (not as flavorful, but likely without that tingly/numbing aspect), along with malt vinegar packets are available.

Beverages : 
We are kinda picky on our Water, not fond of tap water at all due to varying mineral content and sodium content, we usually bring our own from Home, since we buy 15L Ice River water and fill up reusable bottles.

Alternatively we opt to share a can of soda or Iced Tea.  Not many places offer filtered water as an option.  Also, not all bottled water is good quality.  At this venue they charge $1.00 + HST for a small glass of ice water with a 2 slices of lemon.

Parking is rather limited in the little strip.  However, there is additional parking in the adjacent plaza within walking distance.  Debit/cash accepted.  Hard to enter the parking lot if you are heading Southbound on McCowan, other drivers will likely not give way for you to turn in.  I had other drivers blasting their horns at me as I was waiting for a gap in the traffic flow.

Repeat visit ?
Possibly yes, a fellow friend on Yelp, had reviewed made in house fresh onion rings.  So may return to try the fresh onion rings.

$8.65 for a 9"" one- topping pizza, a side salad, and a 20 oz bottled beverage. 
Not just any pizza- this is fantastic, classic pizza.  The sauce is rich and authentic but not too sweet or spicy. I still can't get over the price.
The salad was greens heaped with lots of toppings including pepperoni and cheese. 

The service was friendly and pizza was ready right in time. I can't stop won't stop raving about Roman Fountains lunch special.",2018-10-03 02:45:46,True,0.07651887534688287

With the first snowy and blustery weather of the season, I thought a salad and pizza was in order.  I ended up revisiting a former friend - Roman Fountain.

We did a chicken caesar salad and a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and extra sauce.  Overall, I was very impressed with both the salad and the pizza.  It was very enjoyable and I would recommend them to others.

Note: the chicken in the caesar is kept in a separate container.  The dressing was very good.

The pizza was picture perfect.  Golden crust in a typical Cleveland-style (not thin, nor clearly not deep dish).  My only comment - they hover on that ""slightly skimpy"" range of toppings.  It was enough to qualify as adequate, however it is sitting at that low range.

Extra sauce is a necessity.  Their sauce is very flavorful and quite thick so extra sauce still soaks in well.  To give you an idea, there was still no sauce dripping off the pizza.

Like I said, a perfectly fine job.  The order was taken correctly and it was ready when promised.

Another point worth making, their pricing is reasonable compared to some of their competition. I'm sure being take-out or delivery only and being in business sine the mid-50's allows more favorable pricing.

The cup of green tea was the surprise, for 4$ the taste was awesome and they serve it in ur own tea pot, i think it was called genmaicha. But the main reason we went there was for the Ramen and that was a dissapointment: i can tell the shoyu broth tasted premade, almost instant. The pieces of pork meat had no flavour, they were not flame toasted as other ramen places, and whats more it still had the piece of pork grind attached to it. Usually for ramen you cut the pork skin out. Also had to pay 1.5$ extra for the seasoned egg, and it also did not have much flavour. I love that egg in other places , like in Gagana Ramen, so i was looking forward to it. Then the spicy ramen did taste better, or I should say it has some flavour compared to the Shoyu Ramen, but unfortunately it does not come with pork slices but with grounded pork, lots of cabbage, I think it has kimchi as well.

The selection is better than I find at Ross or Target and alike stores but here's where they lose major points: I can never tell how much anything is!!! I don't have a lot of money to spend on clothes but I do eventually have no choice. I refuse to pay $40 or more on a top. That's ridiculous but the sale signs make it seem doable. However, I find a top, see the tag (let's say $48) then look at the chart on the rack. It'll say, ""if the tag is $37 it's on sale for $19, if the tag says $42 it's now $30, etc.) But so many times the price on the tag is not listed on the chart so I have no freaking idea how much it really is. Instead of making everything up and having ""sales"" that you really want to sell it for, just put the price on the freaking tag!!! Or have everything in the right spot.

I can't come here and count on sticking to my budget and I don't have time to waste checking tag then sign and looking for the right sign only to possibly look like an idiot holding up the line because I have to put stuff back I thought was $12 but was really $50.

There was only one other occupied table, though parking took a while because the lot was pretty full from the other businesses in the plaza. 

There was only one waitress working, which made sense considering the number of patrons in the restaurant. She gave us the menus and brought out the usual side dishes but we had to ask for utensils...but it took a while to be able to ask her because she kind of disappeared after bringing out the sides and our waters! As a result, there were a few minutes where we were just staring at the food, contemplating whether to eat it with our hands out of desperation because we were so hungry, even though the lettuce was kind of wilted. Luckily we were able to hold off until our utensils came, which is when we ordered our food. The waitress was nice enough but the service wasn't particularly friendly or memorable. 

I got a kebob (beef and lamb) in a laffa with a side of fries, and asked for fries to be put inside the laffa too. My friend got something similar, also with fries inside. Of course, when the food came out, there were no fries to be found inside either of our wraps. We had fries on the side anyway, so we didn't bother waiting for the food to be remade after telling the waitress that there were no fries inside. But seriously, we were two of four customers inside the restaurant and the other customers already had their food. There's no excuse to NOT have the order done correctly. 

I'm still giving three stars because even without the fries, the kebob in a laffa was really, really good. The laffa in particular was really nice and chewy. The fries on the side were also good, but it's hard to mess up fries.

After being served water I began to look over the menu, I read a lot of the reviews on this site about the shawarma in a laffa and I had to say while it wasn't the best chicken shawarma I've had. It was still decent, what blew me away though was the other food being served in the restaurant as well as what my girlfriend got.

Taking a look around I noticed a lot of people getting the beef ribs which looked absolutely amazing. (Made me regret my choice of getting shawarma) My girlfriend got the chicken schnitzel which was fairly decent, average fries that are served at most restaurants around the GTA. The Chicken Schnitzel is served with a complete laffa, a salad (decent size), and as well as a side choice along with the schnitzel my girlfriend ended up bringing half of it home due to how much food she received.

Lastly what impressed me the most was the owner who dropped into our table (as well as everyone else's) and proceeded to ask if we had been there before and if we lived in the area, after the small chit-chat he offered us free dessert. While we were so stuffed from the meal I was unsure of how I would be able to fit in anymore. Well I managed to as the baklava as well as the other dessert we were brought were fantastic.

Unlike what other reviewers say, parking is rarely ample: the lot is also used by the busy medical complex that the restaurant is located in during the day and with another restaurant or two in same at night. Since this place opened, parking spaces have been few and far between and the driving in the lot is atrocious.

Like other restaurants in the area, it's loud inside, serving as yet another place where people bump into other people they know, intentionally and otherwise, and then burst into incomprehensibly loud chatter.

Back to the restaurant review now that I've had my rant. Service is pretty bad, I've had to ask for drinks to be delivered multiple times, including one occurrence of one diner receiving their drink and the other ignored. Don't dare tell the server that you need another minute to think about what you're going to order or your table will be deserted.

The food has improved since its opening, I found a number of fellow diners (and myself) were served food that tasted as though it was not seasoned in the kitchen. While food I've had at Ba-Li Laffa since has been better, inconsistency is to be expected.

Appetizer dips, while quite good and definitely taste right, are served with what appear to be what would otherwise be rejected laffas, too thin and usually overcooked. These are not the laffas you're looking for. Salads are exactly as advertised in the menu, no more and no less.

Sandwiches are served in the right laffas, but could be tastier / condiments in them could be more plentiful/better. Requests for the addition of spicy sauce in the sandwiches are frequently ignored (or the sauce is useless). Mains are average.

I haven't experienced the take-out, but it can be rather busy and fills the middle of the restaurant with even more loud people. It certainly appears that orders are much more customizable this way, as the take out is done at the counter where orders are assembled.",2012-09-14 03:26:32,False,0.08236776009858932

It took a while to be seated, and we had to flag down a waitress to get our orders taken. But after that, things went much more smoothly. The food came quickly, and was delicious. The portions are somewhat smaller than I expected, but then again so were the prices ($10 for a shawarma laffa, $8 for a kids meal). The fries were amazing - crispy on the outside and soft and potatoey on the inside. And despite the slow start, the service was friendly and very kind and helpful.

We heard about this place while at Mi Va Mi (which I go to whenever I'm in town) and decided to try it. Do yourself a favor and stay away from Ba-Li Laffa. The humus with mushrooms was ok but the lamb kebab with 'special' rice was awful. The lamb was basically pieces of grilled fat. And the rice was    overcooked white rice with canned peas and carrots. Not so special after all. The server-Anais-while sweet wasn't all that well trained and kept apologizing. We asked for the chicken Shish Kebab and it was just OK. Nothing special or even good.  They left off the potato garnish on this one so I can't comment on what potentially could have been the only edible item.  Needless to say, the experience left us cold. And hungry. We gave our feedback to the server but got the feeling that it would fall on deaf ears. While I'm all for competition, I don't think Mi Va Mi has much to worry about.

While the lower level employees were nice, I can't say the same the about the rest.  Not only was the apartment I rented a wreak, it looked like someone had destroyed that apartment and all they did was lay some paint on the destruction, but they were unwilling to work with us when we needed it most. While understanding that business is business having compassion should still be apart of humanity even in business. We had our banking information stolen as well as all our money. We had to borrow beg and work extra hard to get our bills paid. We tried to let the office know what was going but it was you still need to pay on time or pay hundreds in late fees. We were already paying extra for things that didn't get paid due to payments being returned. It took months to get our money back but by then the damage was done and we were so far behind on everything it was hard to keep up week to week. We had been able to have a little flex money before all this but after it was worse than check to check. Having a family of four eating ramen tuna and rice was horrible I was glad that my kids got more options to eat at school. The weeks before Christmas were hard. We had to tell the kids that we would not be having Christmas but it was okay we could pay rent and I would make it up to them. My son then broke his arm and that made paying on time impossible. I went to the office and I told them, please I need a bit more time I went to court and no one cared. I was forced out of my home two days before Christmas even though I told them I needed a week to make up the money. Fine, they did what they did. we are getting back on our feet we are doing better and I get a call. They want the rent not just from the month we couldn't pay but the three months left in our lease plus late fees. I told them it will take a few months before I will have enough in my budget to pay the $400 a month they want. I was told they would note it in the file. That's it not can you make a lower payment just pay now all or $400 a month. Something I can't do I have loans to pay off from the fiasco of before. They call back two weeks later. asking if now I could pay. I tell them the same thing I asked if I could wait till after summer we should be better off then and things would be paid off. I would have more flexibility. They said they would note the account. I get a call from them again telling me if I don't make a payment soon I will be sent to a lawyer where I will not only pay almost double but also all the legal fees. All I asked was a few months I don't want to have this hanging over my head I want to pay and they do this. I'm trying really hard to keep within my budget and not overspend and they are making so I will end up in the same situation spending more than I have. I'm so angry and disappointed. Why are they pushing this so hard? And here is the kicker. I had called months ago when I had fewer bill and asked what was a good payment plan and the number I was given to call said they didn't have any information on my account. They just started calling me about it last month. It is really discouraging to know people care so little about others and only care about their pockets.

First, when I looked at the apartment I was showed a two bedroom with a ""loft' which was just an extra room with no door and a desk built into the walls. I loved that about it. What I moved into was a three bedroom apartment missing the desk. It took them almost two months to get the desk in the apartment and it was POORLY put in. There were cracks everywhere and the installers left caulking all over. 

As for the apartment itself, mine was located in a beautiful area in the complex. It was almost my favorite place to live thus far in Las Vegas apartment living. The first year was great, it was quiet and clean.

Maintenance is poor. The maintenance manager was great and knew what he was doing, his staff did not. Things were not fixed the way they should have been, just slapped together to make it work. 

When the new management took over, I was forced to pay my ""water, sewer, trash"" bill with my rent even though it is from a different company and had a different due date than rent. They would NOT accept rent without those utilities being paid as well. Their online system sucks, they charge for everything. 

PEST CONTROL uses these really strong chemicals that smelled 8 hours after they came. I was actually worried about my dogs in the apartment while I was gone. Pest Control even left the key to my apartment in the door lock one day after spraying my apartment. Luckily my girlfriend found it first and we held onto it waiting for the office to contact us and let us know that there was a key to our apartment missing and they needed to come and change the locks. That never happened. 

The office staff changed often but the cast of characters were all the same. No one knew what they were doing. The phone is never answered. One staff member will tell you one thing while the manager tells you something else. I had the staff hand me over other peoples packages before, did they even look first? 

Mail boxes are always getting broken into. People leave their dogs feces all over the place even though the apartments threaten extra charges. How are they going to find out who's dog left it? 

I had my car towed from the property! They have a tow company come in once a month or so and tag cars that have been sitting, parked in an incorrect parking spot or cars with missing registration stickers. I was missing a sticker on my BRAND NEW CAR which I had just given them information on a few weeks prior. Since I transferred my registration from my old car to my new car, I did not have a sticker and needed to have one ordered. In the mean time, I communicated this to one person in the office staff. The next day my car was gone. really? After telling management what happened they told me ""I'll see what I can do"" and called the tow company and ""paid"" to get my car out for me. Ridiculous to have this happen when there were broken down cars and people who didn't even live there taking up spaces, which brings me to my next paragraph.

The second year of living in these apartments were the worst. There was someone who moved into a different building than I but still near me. They fought with their ""boyfriend"" all the time, in the middle of the night. The boyfriend did not live there though he stayed and parked in 2 parking spots all the time. They were up all hours, had people coming and going, would scream in the parking lot, screech their tires every time they left and FIGHT in the parking lot. In the middle of the night one time we were woken up to them fighting again then another man got into it, they started fist fighting and someone started yelling about guns. Where is security? Ohhhhh, they leave at 2 am. I asked the office why security leaves in the middle of the night, no answer. I saw security maybe 5 times in the two years that I lived there. 

Honestly, I loved the apartment and I loved how well the property was taken care of. If they didn't want to keep raising my rent, and got rid of tenants that caused problems, I may have stayed.",2018-03-30 22:19:59,True,0.154173331600516

These people will force every penny from you. When I first came to the office here I was told I was only paying rent of $840 and I had to give proof of gas and energy that would be in my name. It wasn't until the day of the lease signing, the day I was to move in, and the day it was too late to move anywhere else that they told me I had to pay water, sewer, trash, and pest. It wasn't on the listing, and it wasn't what we agreed to at the initial meeting. NO ONE mentioned it. By that time, what what I supposed to do? Back out? Be homeless? So, I agreed and thought, 'screw it, I'm out in a year'.

That all being said, apparently the water bill is due today, and the ladies at the office are stone cold as ever. They talk to you like you're below them. They were all chipper when they were luring me into this awful place, but after that, no one has ever been polite or welcoming. Anyhow, I just walked in there today to give them my rent. I was rudely asked if I was going to pay my water bill. First off, water, sewer, trash, pest fluctuates each month. I received a letter YESTERDAY from some creep lurking outside my door stating that the building was going under new management (which hopefully means job layoffs for the office staff). The letter stated that the online payment portal was deactivated and that a utility bill will be sent each month. Sure enough, the site was deactivated. So, I guess a bill was to be expected. I know that my rent is $840. So, since I can't see a balance owed on the site that is deactivated, I will pay my rent and wait for my bill. Seriously, this broad looked at me like I was scum. Actually, they don't really look at you. They look through you and away a lot. They rarely look you in the eye. What for? You're scum to them. I asked her what the balance was, because she didn't even offer to tell me. She just looked at me like I was a homeless person bumming change and that I should be aware of my imposing nature upon her almighty most likely underpaid self.

I'm so ready to get out of here. I hope the new management company cleans house and finds admins whom can actually interact with the human population.

The courtyard is flourishing with aged trees and plantery, it's right behind Vegas' best park (in my opinion), and the interior of the apartments I thought were very charming. My mind has definitely changed. How can I even describe the hell I am living in. I just had a baby and my apartment is infested with cockroaches. I put in a work order for pest control, that we pay for monthly mind you, and it was just some maintenance guy with, what I am assuming, is store bought crap poison, because it didn't work at all. Very disappointing. The roaches didn't even look sick in the slightest. They are still everywhere. I will be calling them again to complain. I don't understand why we pay for pest control when it's just some guy using crap poison. In that case it should be free like most places. 

The post below is very much accurate when it comes to noise. The people next door let all the neighborhood teenagers hang out at their place. They are outside being very loud at all hours of the night. And I mean, they yell, bang on things, blast music on their phones and more. The father of my child has told them to be quiet many times and we have also called the cops. Nothing has helped. They should be evicted. It goes against the lease. It's sad that all summer I have been cooped up in the apartment paying an arm and a leg for air conditioning. Now that it's cool I can't even keep my windows open to enjoy it. When it's daytime, small children are so loud playing outside. At night, the bigger children come out to play. The small children are actually quieter than they are. I wake up all throughout the night, angry and frustrated, when I have to wake up very early in the morning. Security does nothing. I will be making more complaints. I doubt they will do much though. Seems like one of the people that live there work with the apartments anyway. 

The appliances are old. The washer and dryer are old and the buttons don't line up to the settings. I have to turn it to some random setting to get a decent wash. The dishwasher is old too. The fridge open into the wall. I can barely open the produce drawer, and the shelf attachments always falls off and all my condiments fall to the floor. More complaints On the upside, maintenance has been ok. They are pretty quick at getting things done. I will most certainly be putting in more work orders. However, the pest control will need a professional. I have already made plans for that.

Rent is overpriced for such a crappy complex, and you pay water, sewer, trash and pest control btw. Didn't know this until the lease signing. They have a lot of ridiculous fees too and there's mild extortion involved in the whole beginning process.  

Walls are paper thin and neighbors are exceptionally loud. Here's what we hear 24 hours, 7 days a week:

The entire day, small children are screaming, banging on your walls, stomping around, jumping off furniture, aggressively throwing around toys, etc. Our apartment is constantly shaking. Other neighbors have guests at all hours of the night. We hear, not a simple knock, but aggressive banging on doors periodically throughout the night until early morning. We're assuming there are drug deals going on. People are constantly banging things around over there throughout the entire night as well. Just the other day, our neighbor thought that it was a good idea to vacuum at 4 in the morning. On top of this, there are dozens of teenagers running around at all hours of the night, screaming, hooting, hollering, laughing, and banging on the stair rails so that our entire apartment shakes. In the cooler season, when you keep your windows open, you get to hear the neighbor's conversations outside, which always consists of 'getting high' or 'drug deals gone wrong'. Occasionally/about once a month so far, people will scream aggressively at each other for hours and slam doors. Recently there were several women screaming at each other outside in the courtyard at 4 in the morning. This lasted about an hour. Just the other day, a couple were fighting, and the screams were terrifying. I have never heard people scream like that at people they love. Every day and night there is some new thing. 

That's the biggest issue so far. Other issues are security being totally useless. Just some guy walking around on his phone. There have been dozens of people screaming outside at 2 in the morning, and he has done nothing to stop it. Safety is an issue. I have seen drug deals in the parking lot. People sit in their cars, on their phones, acting shady as well. There are some pretty low people living here, and it's hard to believe that management is oblivious to this. Just, don't live here if you're a good person. Find somewhere better. It doesn't matter if you work days, evenings, or grave. . . you will never sleep here.

I moved to these apartments without having ever lived in Las Vegas before and let me tell you, I am extremely disappointed. I can't believe that I pay over $1000 a month for these small, terribly built, poorly managed apartments. 

They advertise having a security gate, however, I have been here over a month and the gate has been open every single day. They say they are waiting on everyone to come get their game openers. Doesnt seem like it should take that long to hand out gate openers. Since I've been here my wallet has been stolen from my car and a neighbors vehicle has been stolen. I have also heard people complain about their apartments being broken into. I have no doubt that this is due to the security gate being always open. We literally live next to a bar/gas station/ liquor store. 

They claim to have over night security. Yes, I have seen someone wearing a shirt that says ""security"" on it, but he is either texting on his phone or working out in the gym when I've see him. 

There are pictures on the website of a playground, but what the don't tell you is that the bedding of the playgroung is 50% wood chips and 50% cigarette butts. Seriously, this playgroung is so disgusting that I would not let my children play on it at first sight. 

Speaking of how this place is not child friendly, what they do not advertise about is the stove and ovens. These units have GAS stoves with the knobs on the front, not in the back. The units look like they're from the 1990's and they offer no replacements or child friendly devices to help out. After my small child turned the stove on and left it on all night, the gas leak not being discovered for almost 14 hours, the CO2 alarm never went off. I have contacted maintenance twice regarding this issue and they never even came by to check my alarm which is clearly out of date. 

Maintenance is very slow in these apartments, taking at least a week to respond to work orders, if at all. Sometime they will come up with excuses to why they could not come to your apartment after all. 

There is an abundance of parking spaces, but for some reason, you only get yo park one vehicle under the half ass awning even though there are plenty of open spaces. They are partering with a towing company to drive around at night and if you have more than one vehicle parking under the awning, they'll tow your vehicle. Doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. They have signs saying you can't back into your spot to make it easier on the towing company. 

They advertise as pet friendly, but their pet waste bins are constantly full and there are never new bags at the station. Sometime they aren't pet friendly and sometimes they are too pet friendly. My downstairs neighbor has a pet that must pee in their hallway because there is a smell in my hallway closet that keeps coming back. I called maintenance about it and they came and sprayed some fabreeze. It still stinks. 

The dumpster locations are far and few between a having maybe four locations for the entire complex although each location has about six dumpsters in each. 

Again, these are NOT luxury apartments. Please beware that all these photos listed of their pool and leasing office is NOT actually how these apartments look.",2015-09-28 09:40:27,False,0.11067038544425423

****The only downfall to this company is when I terminated my year lease I was stiffed with a large bill that was sent to my new address: carpet cleaning $85, general cleaning $90, light paint $35, spray counter tops $250.

I just wished I was given a heads up for these fees or an estimate at the time of signing my contract so I wouldn't be so surprised while opening my mail! My bill was just shy of $400!!!! Plus they didn't even do a walk through when my lease was up!!!!! I called them and asked and they said no walk though needed and to just drop off the keys at thefront desk.

Let's start with the inside of my apartment. I have a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom. The white crown molding, new paint, new doors, and new carpeting really make the place look nice on the inside. We have vaulted ceilings (we are on the 2nd floor), and everyone always comments on how nice our apartment is. The kitchen stove and all of the sinks and faucets are very outdated, and we have white counter tops which stain easy and are made of a cheap material. The wood cabinets are nice, and we have adequate cabinet space. The kitchen sink has a low faucet and is hard to wash anything bigger than a dinner plate or glass in. We do have a dishwasher, but it does not work well(there is no top wash), so we wash dishes by hand. They are slowly updating things, but I doubt the kitchen stoves will be updated anytime soon. Overall, the inside of the apartment is not bad at all.
 
The outside of the apartment complex looks nice, and the buildings are managed nice. The men who fix things are great here too. They do allow dogs here, we have two labs. They are great with pets, but no one seems to care about picking up dog poop. They say they have people come and clean up, but I haven't seen it. My dogs won't even go in the grass because of the amount of poo. I asked them to install a doggy bag station near the problem area, but they didn't seem too interested in that idea.
 
One more thing to be aware of, they DO NOT have 24 hour quiet time. Every night, people are screaming, kids throwing things, and dogs are barking. It is definitely not the place to live if you are a student(like me) that likes to study after work around 4:30-6:00. Our balcony is nice, but we seldom sit out on it for dinner because of the noise.
They advertise Sedona as a ""resort""...it is not that. About 50% of the apartment complex is 18-25 year olds that rev up their trucks and cars at all hours of the evening. The other half of the people are polite and quiet.
I am posting this because I wish I would of known these things before I moved into Sedona at Lone Mountain.  Do yourself a favor and do a walkthrough of the apartment property and community before you sign anything.",2013-02-21 05:35:35,False,1

Strike #1

When me and my family of 5 arrived for my cousins birthday, the restaraunt was below freezing temperature. I've been to many over air conditioned establishment ( movie theatres for example) but this was beyond cold. It almost felt like sitting in a fridge. It was so cold we literally had to grab our jackets, shawl, and even a blanket from our car ( I'm literally not exaggerating). We kindly asked management to turn it down. He said he would tune it off but by the end of our dinner although it was a little less freezing we still felt the cold breeze coming from the vents. One of the women I was taking to when I went to the restroom told me she asked for her and her party to be seated outside on the patio because they couldn't take the freezing restaraunt.

Strike #2

After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked them if we could have some cheesy garlic bread twists to snack on. 3 of us ordered 2 twists each. The waiter said she would get it and bring it for us. 2 minutes later she came back to the table and asked if we still wanted the twists ... we said yes. 5 minutes later she comes back with complimentary chips and dip from management and asks again if we still wanted the twists... we said yes. She responds by saying ""ok, let me see if we have enough"" mind you, we are only asking for 6 twists. 5 minutes later she brings us this ( please see first picture), what looks to be old pieces of bread cut up and toasted with shredded cheese on top ( not twists!). At this point we knew they were out of twists and instead of telling us they decided to con us. 10 mins later we finally get our dry and flavourless food. My cousin ( who's birthday it was) ordered the same twists with her pasta and funny enough she actually got the twists. Looks like they might have only had one or two left and they saved it for my cousins meal. And can you imagine the waitress had the nerve to try and charge us for the old toasted bread with melted cheese. I had to kindly ask her to remove it because they weren't the real twists. ( please see picture of what the twists were suppose to look like in the second picture)

SERVICE:
After declining to be seated in the bar area, which they asked everyone as they waited to be seated, we were seated in the southern area of the restaurant. We figured out quickly that they were sitting families on the southern end, and older adults and seniors on the northern end. Therefore we were sitting among young, loud children. 

The first waiter took her time in getting us drinks and taking our food order, as we mentioned that we were not in a rush for a movie. She did not return, as when our appetizer came, she started serving two large groups of 10+ people, and a male waiter had our appetizer in hand. Neither came back to ask us how we were doing. The male took our plates when we were finished and gave us our bill.

FOOD:
The appetizer we ordered was the ""Four Cheese Spinach Dip."" It was really good - full of flavour. The ""fried pita chips"" that were mentioned on the menu were actually slices of warmed-up pita.

Mains:
1. Thai Curry Chicken Fingers - the menu mentioned that it came with red peppers, green onions, coconut, and green chili sauce. When it came to the table, there was no onion, and the coconut looked like melted cheese (on first taste though, it was definitely coconut). The other problem was that the chili sauce was only on the red pepper, therefore there was a limited amount. 

WARNING: This dish does not come with a free side. I added Sweet Potato Fries which was an additional $3.99.

2. ""No Meat"" Portobello Burger (gluten-free bun requested) - the mushroom was fried, therefore losing the great natural flavours. The goat cheese, red pepper, spinach, and aioli were limited, and if you removed the toppings from the bun, it was not even a lunch-sized salad. The bun itself was huge for the number of ingredients inside and it looked unappetizing. This dish came with a free side. The fries requested had too much potato.

THE BILL:
The male waiter said that he would remove the burger from the bill due to the issues discussed above. When the bill arrived, it had not been removed. We paid the bill and left a low tip.

NOTE: For those who keep strictly Kosher, the options are quite limited, so read the menu carefully. I had thought of getting the Balsamic Chicken, but the balsamic part was a cream sauce.",2017-09-28 02:13:53,False,0.08633396442618747

Pros:
Friendly service
Plenty of seating space

Cons:
Food is very meh at best

Let's get this out of the way first.  I rarely eat at places like Kelsey's, Jack Astors, Casey's, etc.  The only reason we were here was I had a gift card I received from work.  I'm not a big fan of chains honestly to begin with.  

This Kelsey's location is pretty spacious.  It's the perfect place for a family after seeing a movie at the Cineplex next door.  Walking in, we're immediately greeted by a friendly hostess.  When you come to a place like this, expect friendly service with a smile.  It's in the manual of all these types of places.  As long as you're not being a jerk, you'll have a pleasant experience service wise.  

We ordered the fish and chips, chicken apple pecan salad, and a kids meal for our little one which was a pasta dish.  Food doesn't take too long to come out but it wasn't terribly busy when we were there.  

Fish and chips:  I wasn't too impressed with this one.  The batter on the fish was way too crunchy/hard and the fish itself was very mushy.  My work place cafeteria is not the best by far, but even they made a better fish and chips.  The fries were OK, but could not save the dish.

chicken apple pecan salad:  This one according to my GF was much better. There's a lot of variety in the salad which works for and against it.  You get a bunch of different tastes, but not enough of the actual greens because they have so much items to put in. The breaded chicken pieces were pretty good though.

Kid meal:  The fact that my little one took 2-3 bites of the pasta and didn't want anymore said it all.  She usually loves pasta.  I took a bite myself and knew why.  Pasta was way overdone, and barely any sauce.  No taste at all.  The salad that came with pasta was good.

I have to mention for this location (not sure abut the others) they really stepped up their game within the last couple of months. 

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and first thing we noticed are a bunch of limes at the side of the building sitting in the snow, the reason i'm mentioning this is because people could easily slip on them. The whole time we we're there till the end, the limes were still outside, no one cleaned them up. 
Anyway we we're greeted and seated and our server introduced herself. I got to say Kelsey's has a very inviting bar area. They also have pretty good specials. My boyfriend ordered one of the burgers called stack of something and it was on special for 9.99 +fries and i ordered the messy fish sandwich 12.99. 

The food looked ssoooo good when it arrived to our table. I ordered the messy fish sandwich before but it was never this good, the batter was perfect crunchy and not detached from the fish at all. It was a really good amount of fish and IT GETS REALLY MESSY. but its so worth it. I loved it
my boyfriend said he really enjoyed his burger, there was a lot of burger juices coming from it. good sign !! Also a couple  months prior we ordered the loaded nachos which were THE BOMB and battered calamari which i thought was a little tiny bit on the salty side. ALL in ALL I feel better about coming to Kelsey's now and they really do have a good menu and atmosphere.

None the less, this is one of the best Kelsey's I've ever been to, as I've had horrible experiences with other Kelsey's locations.  I've come here numerous times and most recently I came here to watch the Raptors Home Opener.  I started with their drink special of the day, which was their Beer-ita, which is a ""the best of both worlds"", blended Tequila margarita topped with an upside down icy cold Corona.  Always good to have daily drink specials at a restaurant.  We ordered our traditional Spinach Dip (which might I add, that I am addicted to!) and I like to be a bit different and order my pita chips half baked and half deep fried, just to give it some variety.  Obviously, the deep fried tastes better but when you eat baked pita chips you feel healthier.. Definitely recommend this appetizer.  We also ordered the Calamari which usually comes with a seafood sauce but we also asked for Sweet Chili Thai sauce on the side.  Their Calamari is mediocre to me, nothing special.  To name a couple of other dishes I've had here, we've had the Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins (which I thought were pretty good, the boyfriend wasn't that much of a fan), Wonton Nachos (which aren't as good as their original tortilla chips), their wings (which I definitely recommend with whatever sauce you desire), Messy Fish Sandwich (one of my favourites and always a go-to), the ""HOLY BLANK"" 7 Layer Burger (which the boyfriend demolished and loved), Sizzling Fatijas (good to share and smells and tastes oh-so-delicious!), and Brew- Battered Fish and Chips (nothing special).  The customer service at this particular location is fantastic, and we always request for Matt, who has been there for quite a long time but he loves what he does and he's good at what he does too!

I decided to try their balsamic glazed chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables. So, my entree came with two chicken breasts completely soaked in the sauce with just a bit of mashed potatoes and veggies. I could not finish my meal because of the overbearing amount of the glaze on my plate. The mashed potato on the side tasted a lot better than anything and I would have preferred having that as my main to be honest. Tip: ask for the sauce to be on the side. 

Others at the table had the salmon entree and a steak with chipotle shrimp. Both really enjoyed their food and finished their meals. Hence 2 out of the 5 stars. 

I also happened to stumble upon a very interesting dessert they offered..Nutella filled donut bites...!!! How can you resist something like that?? So I ordered them and I did not expect to get so many, so definitely only get them if you're 2+ at a table or super hungry for some chocolate! They were really good, minus being very fried.

As far as food chains in Canada go, Kelsey's is like the Coffee Time of the coffee chain world. They have a variety of items but the quality is meh...

The layout is nice and they have a big bar area with large TVs.  The service is pretty friendly but I think that's pretty standard and part of the standard corporate manual for all of the food chains.

There are plenty of food items to choose from.  Probably about the same amount as a place like Jack Astors but a few less than Pickle Barrel or Boston Pizza.  If you're really hungry, this place probably gives you most food on your plate. In fact, if you're more than one and neither of you are very hungry, you might be able to get by with one appetizer and one main.

Sadly, the reason why this food chain is at or near the bottom of the food chain is that it is afraid to use seasoning. I've never had so many items taste like water.  The potato skins were bland, the batter on the chicken fingers had no flavour and even the vinaigrette salad dressing had no acidity. 

I'm not sure if their chefs are worried about customers complaining that their food is too spicy or if they are trying to cut costs but if there's no taste in the food and you're going to give big portions, you're going to end up with alot of waste.  I think the best thing a customer can do with their unfinished food is take it home and repurpose it into their own meal and use their own seasoning to make it better.

- Accommodates kids and dieters (they have a nutrition guide online)
- Servers are quick
- You can buy your movie ticket from them for $8
- Food is consistent

The few times I needed a personal banker and not just a walk up to the counter, I had to hope someone was free or make an appointment and stop back at an arranged day and time.

I miss the day of Smitty's Big Town in Scottsdale where I felt like a part of the branch.  You'd stop in and see familiar faces as tellers.  They knew you by name and could talk to you about current events.  Seems like times have changed a lot since those days.

Now my account is actually set up for ATM use only.  I am supposed to be charged to speak with a teller at the counter although the fee is waived on my accounts because we have our mortgage with BofA also.  It just seems like banks have done away with the personal touches that used to be commonplace.

The phony high school student working as a bank representative there did stop the charges, I'll give him credit for that. (This requires signing up for a new ""free"" banking system that requires you to use your B of A credit card once a month or face a $15 fee. And no, on-line purchases don't count. Go figure.)  But when I asked about refunds or at least finding out why my account changed without my knowledge, he said something about his computer being down and that he would call me within the week to let me know.

It's been a month now. Guess if I've heard from him. 

I was also supposed to get new checks for getting the new account. Nope! Not yet, anyway!

Since I've been a B of A customer I've dealt with $1400 in bank fraud, (which they refunded and then suddenly took back out of my account when a representative made a typo on the amount,) have received checks with the wrong account number on them and then denied new checks when I didn't bring one in for proof, have been denied a bank letter required for a student visa, have been charged fees for not having money in an account I'd already closed, and countless other annoyances that are unacceptable for banking.

My friend and I arrived at around two o'clock and three tables were occupied. A faux fire area occupies the centre of the restaurant and a ninja door, tables and booths surround it. A television is on the wall giving the customers the perception that this is a low-end and low-quality food joint. 
This newer and more modern location is quite different in ambiance from their original mid-town location south of Bloor.

The food was quite good. I had the katsudon and could tell that they are using the correct Japanese recipe. The pork was tender, the onions done right and the rice cooked to 'don' perfection. The spinach was delicious. One can taste the seasoning in it. Upon request they also brought katsu sauce for me. The salad side and miso soup were also welcome with the former enjoying a refreshing dressing.
My friend had a Hiyashi Chuka (cold ramen noodles) and found it okay. Hiyashi chuka could come with a clear, sesame or soy broth and she was disappointed that she did not get her favourite sesame broth. Nothing wrong with her noodle dish, but this version was not her favourite. Moreover, they mix the noodle in while others may keep the noodle separate. I had a Hiyashi Chuka years ago at their original location and remembered how the Saga-born waitress had recommended it. They always promoted cold ramen there in the summer and seem to do so here as well. Also, was it my imagination? They used to add ham to Hiyashi Chuka there. Not here. They stick with pieces of regular pork. The egg was well done.

I recall how the original location's waitresses were Japanese every time I went. It was not the case here. The waitress' answers and accent tells me she was not Japanese. She was polite and kind regardless.",2019-06-30 19:27:33,False,0.09482014500249192

I came here as a walk-in as a group of 4 and luckily there was no line and we had just seen a table open up from a fully packed restaurant. We were told we would be seated there when it was cleared but instead, the servers came back and said they had promised it to an existing party of 2 already who wanted to sit in the booth. Ok - minor inconvenience but we just came for dinner so the servers offered us the counter instead once they cleared it. We happily agreed to that. 

However, the servers then came back and told us the counter seats were reserved so there was no table available for 4 anymore. Bigger inconvenience because we came to the area just to try the food here, as we are all fans of the downtown location, and now had to wait an unknown amount of time. There was no sign of a table for 4 opening up so we settled on splitting our group and taking two tables for 2 across the restaurant from each other. 

At my table, we did not get any menu for over 10 minutes nor did anyone come to our table after we were seated. I texted my friend on the other side of the restaurant to see if he got a menu yet and he brought over their extra menu because they had two. We also saw a person walk up to the servers to ask if they could place their order because they had been waiting for a while, albeit with a menu at their table. Looked like a few folks were not happy about the service that night. 

Food took terribly long. It took so long that the table of 2 that moved to the 4-seater had finished their meal and left. Our two tables were eventually able to move and sit together at the original table we were promised - all this happened after about 40 mins after originally being seated and still before any food was served. 

When the food did come out, about another 15 minutes after we moved (and almost an hour from originally being seated), they missed one meal so that ended up coming another 15 mins later. The servers said they would give us a discount for forgetting the food and we ended up with a 15% discount - similar discount you would get if you tagged them on Instagram. 

About the food, the curry is great! The same great flavour as the downtown location. They ran out of the beef skewers but the chicken one was ok. Good green onion flavour. Only good things to say about the food but the terrible service soured my experience here. The servers were pleasant and polite, and I believe they were working to the best of their ability, but there seems to be poor management/training of the staff.

The interior was beautiful and the servers were polite but the food has a really long way to go.

Firstly the menu needs a lot of work. My vision is pretty good but there is no way I can see what each of the pictures had. I ordered a cold udon that appeared creamy orange in the picture but something different came out. The cold udon was neither cold or warm..... Kinda like room temperature and stale. Ingredients and flavour was plain but the side of wasabi was an interesting touch but my partner wasn't a fan of wasabi unfortunately. I strongly believe the average individual can make a more exciting dish at home with frozen udon, some beef at Galleria and vegetables. The quantity they served was hilarious when they serve small portions in a massive bowl. 

The sukiyaki tasted bland since the meat was over cooked and it was stuffed with very boring ingredients (think overcooked tofu and bean sprouts). Theres a pretty thick film of oil on the surface after the meal too. This dish was a fail for something in this neighborhood.

I was impressed with their compliance with food safety practices. We were there during dinner time and they had a backlog of wraps to make. One of the workers put a couple of wraps-in-progress on a different counter. The supervisor immediately called him on it and made him throw them out as the other counter had not been sanitized. 

They offer 3 different meats (beef, lamb & chicken), falafel, dolmades, samosas and some salads. There are 2 different sizes of wraps offered - just be advised that the large is probably more than some people can eat. I am opting for the smaller size for my next visit. 

Mustafa threw in a couple of free baklava to our order (which were delicious!). The only improvement that I could possibly make would be to have tabbouleh offered instead of parsley for the wrap, but that is just nitpicking.

We heard the drunkards rolling in at 2 am, the early birds going to breakfast, kids running down the hall, cleaning carts rolling, you get the idea... if you're a light sleeper, avoid. Cleanliness was merely O-K.

1 - There is a ""free breakfast"", but the menu items don't change, and it's made with the minimum effort. I'd sooner have gone to a local diner - we forced the food down because it was there and convenient - not because it was edible. 

2 - The pool is an oddity, with a deep end that goes to 10 feet (who does that anymore, and why?!?!?) Also, depending on where you are in the hotel, expect to have to take a plane, a train, and an automobile to get to the pool... we had to walk down 2 VERY long hallways, go down 3 staircases, and walk down another long hallway just to get to it... is this the Comfort Inn exercise program? 

3 - Expect the outside entry doors to not take your card... it's a fact, and the hotel staff will tell you outright the key entries are old and don't work. If you go outside, plan to have to bang on the door to beg some other sap to let you in, or to have to go through the lobby.

4 - Parking is LIMITED... if you arrive any time past 5:00 pm ET (or come back from a day out), plan to have a really tough time finding a spot to park.

Sleep: Borderline poor. Note the details in the ""room"" section - I'm a light sleeper, and the noise was tough on me at points through the night.

Hotel Staff: Non-existent. The staff manning the desk was okay, not overly nice, not rude. They handed me our keys, and that was that. We never saw nor heard from them again.

Value: Poor, considering the location and the run-down state of the hotel. It was clean enough, yes, but bare bones, not up to modern standards by a long shot. Their rooms don't measure up to nearby competition... They either need to significantly lower their prices,or drastically improve the quality of the hotel and its rooms.",2014-07-07 19:51:48,False,0.1164113106240921

One main hall and all it's rooms were closed.  All other halls were open. 

 I have been to nicer hotels but this one was very large and would room large parties of people and you could even have the party or wedding at the hotel. They had a full breakfast despite what the fact that the photos only show cereal. And a breakfast room with a view. High above the Hwy.  

I had a non smoking pet friendly room that had sliding glass doors so I could take the dog straight out of the room and walk her. They beds where like sleeping in the clouds. I am not a fan of a hard bed. They did forget the conditioner in the shower.

Like the previous reviewer said, it goes up a long and winding road. The only bar you could walk back to is from the hotel bar [a pity]. The hotel was partially outdated, some parts were freshly painted and new carpeting but the bathroom had not been remodeled in some time, which doesn't bother me, but what does, is that they weren't maintained very well. One of the bedspreads had crayon still on it. 

It came with a mini-fridge. Location-wise, just south of 376, there's sprawling surbubia with its chain retail about a mile away; North of 376, where the Comfort Inn is located, is the contrast, a land of complete hilljacks, including a building that housed both a spay and neuter pet clinic and a country saloon. 

The breakfast bar [which also doubles as the hotel bar] wasn't much: powdered eggs, sausage, juice, make your own waffles, toaster, bread, bagels, oranges, jams, and coffees, oatmeal packets. Bagels did the job for me. 

The place was pet-friendly, although there were 2 dogs across the hall that barked for some of the night, driving my dad crazy. Next room over, I was the heavy sleeper and didn't care. On the plus side, there's an indoor pool, free wifi, and a mini-fridge in some of the rooms including ours.. 

I also second that parking was difficult to find the one night that there was a wedding there. The tennis courts were overgrown with weeds and not even usable.

This was the cheapest place I could find with a room that could accommodate all of us (me and youngest in the King bed - it was Mother's Day weekend, and I claim the big bed!; middle son and oldest on the pullout sleeper sofa). Plus, it had an indoor pool/hot tub with which to keep the youngest two occupied. The location (immediately off I-376) was close enough to where we were going to be hanging out (The Waterfront in Homestead) and also conducive to taking their little happy asses back home.

We got there about 4 PM and to get to the hotel, you have to go up this very steep, curvy hill. One thing about Pittsburgh - they can build anything on a hill. Upon checking in, it turned out we arrived at the same time the people from the wedding reception did. It also appeared that most of them were spending the night there too. Joy.

The hotel is considerably old - I think the carpeting is a lovely burnt orange from the 70's, with distinct brown spots that may either be designs or blood stains. I'm not sure which. There are three sections to the prison....er, hotel - A, B, and C. We were in the C-section (ha!) on the first floor, which had a little patio that faced woods. It's weird - none of the levels really match the building next to it, so what was the first floor of one building was the second floor of the other building. Tres confusing.

Upon entering the room and leaving the sketchy hallway, I was happy to see that the rooms were up to date. I was not amused to see that the television was on - I wasn't quite sure I was in the right room or if someone else was there. Luckily, we were the only people who were supposed to be in there. The hotel has WiFi and the room had a mini fridge; the one thing that it didn't have was a lot of outlets, especially any around the bed or the computer desk. We had to unplug most of the lights in the room so that we could run two laptops and two PSP's.

We went out for the evening and came back around 11 PM, only to find all of the well lit parking places taken. We had to park pretty far from the door, and it was in a dark area that was surrounded  by woods. Nothing screams ""target!"" like a single woman with small kids. We  made it to the hotel entrance okay, and I'm writing this review, so I am assuming we were all unscathed.

The bed was very comfy and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. Little room, if any, to navigate in there. Basically the toilet is almost IN the shower. It is also very low to the ground, so you're sitting with your knees up by your ears almost. The previously documented bottle opener was also right at eye level as you were sitting. That weirded me out.

Offspring and I went to go get our complimentary breakfast so that we could take it down to the pool and eat poolside before they went in. What a cluster***k! There were almost 100 people in that restaurant, and most of them were of Indian descent, all screaming at each other, and cutting in front of people just to grab stuff. I am lucky that we made it out of there with two bowls of cereal and a piece of sausage. 

The pool is very large, and it was nicely heated (although the pool area itself was cold as all get out). Kids will like it - it's a pool. Adults should be fine with it. I took advantage of the hot tub - I sat on the edge of it with my legs covered up to my knees in water because it was so cold in there and I read a book. 

All in all, we lived. Would I stay here again? Most likely not. There are other hotels in the area that were about the same price range, with the same amenities, and less sketch factor. But, if all you need is a place to stay and you're fine with the above, then this place should suit you fine.

Not the biggest fan since I prefer the thin layer. I take all my friends who come over the day after then eat it by the Lakeshore East or by our porch. A gem in the burbs! It's more expensive than others for a reason but that will not stop us being regulars till the end of summer! 

PS. I have yet to try the chocolate soft serve. Everytime order, the machine is broken. Hopefully this is already fixed!",2019-07-19 03:08:23,False,0.0602311867051793

This store is located in a newer plaza of stores, which features a Longo's and a Starbucks. I parked in short-term parking, steps away from the store, as I knew that I wanted a small ice cream sample before lunch. Yes, I had dessert well before a late lunch.

I walked in and was greeted with a ton of chocolate bars, fondue flavours in cans, and gift ideas. I looked at everything with curiosity and delight. Oddly, it felt like home to me, especially when I looked at the chocolate-covered nuts.

I looked at the various options on the menu when a helpful woman walked me through how to order. I am such a novice. This year has been resurrecting my ice cream sweet tooth and it caused me to get my conehead badge on Yelp!

You can order either a cone or a cup in four different sizes. I went with the mini, which is the second-smallest size. Ice cream flavours come in vanilla, chocolate, orange, raspberry, and swirl combos. You can also do sorbet. You can get either dipped in whatever flavour you want. You and your server simply walk over to the dipping area and choose.

I went with the raspberry-vanilla swirl. The raspberry is closer to a sorbet, but I loved the sweet-tart combination, especially paired with the vanilla. My order was roughly $6. It's not cheap, but if you come here periodically, it's all good.

We walked over to the dip flavours. I looked at this blue milk chocolate dip. It was cotton candy. You can sample these dips for free. I sampled this mysterious blue dip. You know what? It tastes EXACTLY like cotton candy at an amusement park. Sold!

You can do either the regular dip or go crazy with kooky, which has cookie bits and probably more sugar. I was fine with the regular dip. You can also get sprinkles on top. I decided not to do it, as the dip had enough sugar for my liking.

You can pay by cash, and debit and credit cards. I paid with a credit card. All went smoothly.

I grabbed a plastic spoon and napkins, thanked this woman, and left.

I bit off the top part of the dip, and got into the raspberry-vanilla ice cream. They worked so well together. Yum!

The dip is pretty thick. I had difficulty biting through it as I worked through my cup. At one stage, I essentially put my entire face into the cup to try and bite through it. I recall seeing plastic knives at the store. I now know why you need one. Considering how thick the dip is, with my luck, I would likely break the knife. Perhaps I should carry a pocket knife before I head over to this place.

I then had another thought. How do you eat the cone version with dip? I would have blue cotton candy dip all over my face eating all that.

There are vegan and dairy-free options. You can do sorbet in raspberry and mango varieties. You can also do frozen bars that looked delicious! The bars can also be dipped.

I'd come back for more. The sorbets and bars are next on my list. I also loved the gift baskets and ideas.

We ordered two Kooky Cones (in cups). Both were mediums. First of all, there is WAY more chocolate than ice cream on the cone. It was yummy at first but It made for a very delightful balance half way in and was way too sweet for us to even be able to eat any more of it.

Some quick tips: Start off with the baby or mini size.  With the number of times they dip the cone into the melted chocolate (of your choice), it'll be sugar overload.  If you can eat more, then hey, you can try other flavours and toppings!

The soft serve ice cream itself is delicious.  Very creamy! I'm sure many people will focus more on the toppings but if you're someone looking for just a regular/plain soft serve ice cream, then you won't be disappointed. 

I haven't tasted all of the chocolate sauce but so far, the ones I've tried are very good.  Seems as though they had taken chocolate bars and just melted them as they are quite rich.  Whenever you get a cone, they dip the ice cream 2 to 3 times and in the end, the chocolate coating will be pretty thick.  This is why I recommend starting off with a baby or mini size.  

Whether or not you're very much into sweets and may or may not find it too be too much, it'll still taste really good. I'm personally happy that there is such a cool trendy place in the east side and that you don't have to make a trek downtown.

Upon entering aromas of sweet milk chocolate began filling your senses. At 6pm on a Saturday evening it was starting to get quite busy. There is a case of handmade chocolate truffles and off in the distance I see the chocolate dipping station and a soft serve machine. They also offer tons of packaged chocolates, canned fondues, chocolate lollipops, and some cooking utensils.
For those who are unfamiliar with this Quebec based chain it is an artisinal chocolate shop whose speciality is selling soft serve ice cream that is hand dipped in 1 of 12 real chocolate flavoured dips. They also have milkshakes, gourmet hot chocolates, and soft serve icecream on a waffle or brownie.
Although we had already had a huge dinner and dessert how could I turn down trying that famous dipped ice cream. They have quite a bit of seating here if you want to stay and enjoy your dessert however we got everything to go. They offer a variety of sizes but I went with the smallest size called ""baby"". They had only 2 flavours of soft serve that night vanilla and orange so I got a vanilla dipped in dark chocolate.
The baby size was actually a perfect amount for me considering I just wanted a little something. The soft serve itself isn't anything to write home about just your typical vanilla. However the real highlight here was the quality of the dip. The chocolate used was delicious! The dip was quite thick and rich and for dark chocolate it was on the sweeter side almost more semi sweet tasting to me. However the coating was really hard and I had a tough time biting through it. I was glad I asked for in a cup because If I was biting a cone I could see it shattering everywhere however I still had a heck of time cracking through the chocolate coating to get to the ice cream especially with my plastic spoon. The chocolate also solidified to the cup and although it was mighty tasty I hard time chiseling it off the cup.
Hubby got a small Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake. He said it was good but he wasn't wowed by it.
Overall I have to say there chocolate is on point. It's an interesting concept of a shop and something different to have around. I'll be back to try out some of there chocolates and if the craving hits again I wouldn't mind to try a different flavoured dip soft serve or perhaps the brownie or waffle topped ice cream.",2018-02-18 02:44:56,True,1

To put that into perspective, well, proper perspective, I have been made ill by restaurants and their food, and I dislike this dump more. 

The man stands back in the kitchen conducting business like he knows something - he doesn't know anything let alone tasting quality!

HEY! I've had three dishes in three visits and they all taste like dog food. The spicy Thai beef tasted like horribly-tasting spicy dog food meat. Oh, the orange hue on the beef is odd in and of itself. The curry is Dog Food Soup. What little flavor was there is quickly even buy the rice and you are just left for the plate full of mush.

I know they have a sign up stating they are working on their menu but katsu chicken is katsu chicken not Oyakodon like they gave me.   The cashier told me emphatically that it is their katsu chicken so I assumed it might just look a little different now.   Once I got home to eat it I realized it is definitely not katsu.   I called and spoke to the manager and she just went into the fact it is a different version of katsu and that it takes a little longer to cook instead of listening to me.

From my experience most of these reviews on here are are accurate.  Being new to the area and not knowing their extensive history of customer dissatisfaction I stopped in between work and a meeting at church.  Since Dairy Queen was offering a free cone on the first day of spring 3/20/17 I figured I would stop by to grab that and something to eat.  It was about 6:15pm and they were closed even though Dairy Queen website says they are open until 8:00pm.  Jumping forward a little bit when I called today the rude lady said they close at 5 on Mondays.  Seriously what restaurant closes at 5?  When I looked on the door it had two signs on the door.  One that because they are a franchise they will only be participating in the free cone from 11-12 today.   That is insane because I would guess all the other franchise Dairy Queen's were giving them away all day.  The second sign said they were out of chocolate ice cream (which on Wednesday is still on the door). So they apparently can not keep food in stock like previous post state and they can't order it when they do run out.  When I called the store today I asked to speak to the manager to get the name and contact information for the owner franchise owner.  She rudely said why are you asking so I explained what happened Monday and instead of complying she just gave the excuse about being a franchise they don't have to follow Dairy Queen programs.  When I tried to question her isn't that what a franchise does receive their food and licensing from Dairy Queen she said no and then announced she was hanging up without giving me the information I sought.  Then when I tried to call back they just let it ring.  Since it was only a short drive I decided to go and talk to the manager only to find that on Wednesday's they close at 6pm 2 hours before the time the Dairy Queen says they close.  The funny thing in the 5 minutes that I was looking at something on my phone in the lot 5 other customers drove up and walked up to the door to find that they were closed.  Maybe the owner should write a book about poor customer service and how to lose money.

The location was clean and orderly when I visited but it was also completely dead. I was quickly greeted by two teen girls when I walked in who were ready to offer help. I had come on a mission to relive the childhood glory of having an ice cream cake for my birthday. After I picked out my cake the girls asked if I wanted anything written on it and let me pick a color and even clarified if I wanted an exclamation point. Service: five stars. However, it's not enough to bump up the star rating of this review.

Quality: two stars. So sad. I know my palate has changed since I was a kid, but I really think they've changed their recipes. 
+ Caramel and crunchies: still delicious and gooey and the reason for getting DQ over Carvel or a store brand. Never change, filling! It's exactly as I remember it. 
- The ""whipped cream"" decorative frosting. I was obsessed with the light, fluffy frosting that made the flowers and decorated the edges of the cake. Now it is heavy and tastes like food coloring and seems like it's made with corn syrup. Such a bummer. I've been craving this frosting for years and it doesn't look like I'll ever have it again. 
- The ice cream itself. It has no flavor aside from a sort of milky quality. If you blindfolded me I'd have no idea there was a difference between the chocolate and vanilla layers. The chocolate layer is so light it barely registers as a different color. Their website photos show the cakes as I remember them; my cake was not a chocolatey wonder. I still eat my cake in the same way I did as a kid - eat the frosting, eat the vanilla, eat the chocolate, then eat the filling. I might as well just eat it like a normal person now because the filling is the only thing with flavor.

Do Not eat food here, unless you like the thrill of being poisoned. 

As for the ice cream---I have never been to a DQ where I've been told they were out of a specific blizzard mix.

First of all, the line was out the door.  We assumed that it was just a busy night.  Turns out they were out of multiple items (and did not put a sign up). People were upset and walking out.  Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?  

I get up to the counter and ask a question about the ingredients of a Brownie Batter blizzard.  They are like, it is just brownies.  My response: Anything else?  They had to go ask someone.  What?  Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.  We never got a receipt.  When I asked for one, they said they did not have any.  What?!

We pay and wait.  And wait.  Oh, but while we wait, we get to watch the kitchen person.  He was making a chicken sandwich.  With his LONG ponytail hanging over the grill.  Yum?  More like gross.  Then both my husband and I notice that he grabbed a raw chicken breast (while not wearing a glove) and placed it on the bare counter.  He then wiped his hand on his pants.  What?  Salmonella much?  Any food standards?

We get our medium blizzards.  The ice cream normally extends to the top or slightly over the top of the cup.  This time the ice cream barely made it to the top of my cup. My husband had ice cream under the cup.  When we asked if this was a medium, they said yes.  And just walked away.

They also happen to be pretty healthy choices which I should point out for those of you that like your grease and carbs of plenty. They have about a dozen different types of salads which you choose how many scoops of each you want. Then you can add protein to it in the form of grilled chicken, ahi tuna and so on. Everything looks very fresh and as though it was just made. It looks that way when I have been there I should say. 

They also offer three flavors of lemonade. I always get blueberry mint. It comes with fresh mint leaves and is always very cold which I love. I have favorites when it comes to the salads. The edamame and tuna salad and the squash and kale are my favorites. I've tried three other kinds of salads and they weren't bad they just weren't my thing. The salads tend to be a little bland; I think they either under season them or don't put any sea salt in them. 

Now you might be confused with how often I've been here and how I really enjoy the drink and salads I always get as to why I would give them only three stars. There is one specific employee or manager there that I find really rude every time he's there. The rest of the employees are very friendly and nice to talk too. They all have a really, really hard time with the scoop system that they use. You have to choose how many scoops of each salad you want and they have different scoop sized dishes. Every time I go it's different. I'll tell them I would like two scoop of each salad. It should be up to them to ask if the salads should all be in the same container or separate containers. Half the time they get out a huge container and start putting my salads in the same container without asking. Then I feel horrible but I have to have them separate because it usually takes me a few days to eat it and I don't like my flavors mixed. This seems to cause a huge confusion and they somehow can't add two and two anymore and I'll end up with one scoop of the first salad and three of the other or four of each and because of the way I am I just take it. I know two plus two is not difficult and at the beginning I say I would like two scoops of each salad so I know it's not my fault. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if it didn't happen every single time and if I didn't see it happen with other people. Plus this place is very expensive. Each scoop will cost you $3.50 and that adds up fast as the scoops are small. 

The biggest and I believe extremely important complaint I have that in the end may cause me to stop going is the lack of work hygiene. Even subway puts on gloves just to scoop out soup into the soup cups. At dirtbelly I have never seen an employee wash their hands or put on gloves. They don't wear hairnets or at least hats with ponytails. I'm guessing they would argue it's because they don't touch any food but that's wrong. I've seen them touch the inside of the salad containers when they pick them up with their hands, touch the part of the lids that touch the food, they make your lemonade with their hands and the last time I went the man at the till stuck his entire bare hand inside the little bag he used tongs to put my coconut balls into. He handled money, credit cards, touched his face, the counter and God know what else and the stuck his hands inside the bag my food touched bare. I have been sick for almost ten years now with kidney and immune problems so stuff like that can be really dangerous to me. I was afraid to say anything because of the rude employee I mentioned from before so I paid for and took something that could kill me. I'm not exaggerating by the way. A regular persons hands can carry MERSA which can kill anyone on top of other things that would make me very ill. The answer to this complaint should not be for me to stop eating there because these things don't meet food and safety regulations for everyone. It should be them that changes. If they made a person ill or killed a person it could end their business let alone how horrible it would be for that to happen. 

I would love to have written a long review on how amazing the food is here and hopefully one day I can. The health issues and inability to work their own scoop system has to be dealt with though.",2016-04-02 14:23:42,True,0.182227562925662

Having said that, the food at Dirtbelly looks so fresh, and clean. I should've taken a picture of the salad ingredients, but there was just so many choices! The salads are $3.5 a scoop with the option of adding seared ahi tuna or grilled chicken. I opted to get 4 scoops of salad... I don't remember what was in them... but I loved the one with the beets and also the butternut squash one! Both were super filling, and not overly oily. 

I also got their Mango Kaffir Lime Tealada. It tasted like... a limeade, no mango flavor; which I didn't mind.. and it did make me smile like their description said :) Albeit... I was very scared I would end up eating their paper straw... Note to self: Paper straws are not made for straw biters.

We tried a tuna ""baco"", a chicken baco, and a broccoli side, and all were very fresh and tasty. It was a pleasant surprise getting food this nice in a shopping mall food court.

Having said that, the food wasn't perfect. The baco bread was surprisingly, unforgivably tough and chewy. Both bacos were kinda skimpy on the protein. And, at the risk of being too nitpicky, the $8.50 bacos were a weird tweener size -- one baco isn't enough for a meal, but two is too much. I suppose the idea is that you order a baco and a couple of sides, which at $15 would end up being pretty steep for a food court meal.

Last but not least, the little side we got was packaged in a non-recyclable plastic container. It kind of sucked to throw it away after using it for five minutes.

Still, this is the best place in Market Mall's food court -- it tastes like real food, not food court junk food. Definitely tasty enough for a return visit.

Edit: The bacos we ordered on our second visit were soft and fluffy like we expected them to be, so I chalk up the tough, chewy bacos we got on our first visit to startup problems (our first visit was on the first day they were open).",2016-03-08 02:25:00,False,1

First my appointment was pushed off 15 minutes because they were behind schedule, so I actually had to reschedule a meeting I had planned that day.

Then to compensate for using the incorrect product which, apparently, damaged my skin's barrier, they switched up the second mask planned to one that left my skin super oily for at least an hour, so I had to cancel the meeting altogether.

The problem is that I was already overcharged because the waitress entered my sandwich as a large instead of small. Small is $9.95, when I told the owner, she said you already paid for it, and it's been made. So I was charged $12.25 for the sandwich instead of $9.95. When I got back to the office, I called the validation number myself, and the IVR said it was valid, and that the coupon is now marked as redeemed. My total bill should have been $24.68 before taxes, $27.89 after taxes. Instead my bill was $28.18 before taxes, $32.49 after taxes, a difference of $4.60. I've already contact customer service for the Entertainment Coupon company and I'm awaiting their reply. Its a shame this happened, as the food was good. I had the Japanese Salad 5/5

f_PHRTAUNcLhBl3HIVvxRg,AQ68GdYacVeqqqroAh9eOA,_eRcc1OFDbi3fnVBskXP9g,4.0,2,0,0,"In his book ""Save the Deli"", David Sax discusses the rise and fall of delicatessen culture in North America and beyond. He points to the challenges in defining a 'real deli', and the increasingly high economic barriers to sustained success. 

Mr. Sax describes several delis which have stood the test of time; those that have been lost to history, and some which have tried against the odds to resurrect what seems like a dying approach to food. 

Since he wrote his book, some of his examples have thrived, while others blossomed only to wither and ultimately fail. 

Zelden's is a funny example. It began life decades ago, as ""Zeli's Deli"" up in the wilds of Thornhill. Facing intense competition from several similar restaurants, it eventually closed. The food was fine; the ambiance typical for a deli; the space outfitted in diner kitsch. If there was a public outcry, I missed it since I was likely eating at Centre Street (sorry), which offered a closer rendition of the Montreal Deli my family preferred. Zeli's is not name-checked by Mr. Sax, although Centre Street, the now-Closed Caplansky's and the Pickle Barrel (which has undergone the worst conversion since Bob Dylan went Born-Again) do. 

And yet, ten years post Save the Deli, the family that owned Zelis has returned to the fray, at Yonge and St Clair of all places. 

For me, deli belongs to a category of food that I associate with childhood. It's tough to review on that basis since 1) anything I eat competes with my memories, and 2) my palate was different then. Was the Apollo 12"" hot dog at the Pickle Barrel really that good, or does it benefit from a slathering of nostalgia and the fact that I've eaten a much greater variety of stuff since I was a kid? That said, familiar flavours in comfy settings often lead me to give the benefit of the doubt over things I might raise: machine-slicing, for instance, which produces a thinner, more uniform cut (and can help out with a tougher cut of brisket since the fibres are cut shorter) but somehow makes for a less substantial sandwich if the meat is great. 

i visit over lunch hour. The place enjoys a steady stream of customers, plus a busy takeaway trade. A pair of meatniks work the aforementioned slicers almost constantly. 

I'm directed to seat myself and choose a booth towards the back. It's hot outside, and the air conditioning fights a losing battle, especially with the door swinging open constantly. 

My waitress is part of the original family. She provides some detail. She knows her stuff, and can speak to the different menu options, which are legion. 

Perhaps in response to some of the concerns raised in Sax's book, Zelden's tries to re-brand itself as ""the evolution of deli"". Smoked meats find their way into burgers and poutines and wontons and tacos and spaghetti, or are offset with avocados and Asian sauces. I'm sure they're good, but I eschew them in favour of an old school pastrami sandwich on rye bread, with French fries and cole slaw. A full sour pickle rides along. My dining companions order a brisket sandwich and a salad with turkey. 

The brisket is good. A normally dry cut is moist and meaty, filling the requested Kaiser nicely. The salad (normally a sad, dietetic affair at most delis) is a huge plate of greens and fresh veg. The turkey is smoked in house. It is also fresh and deeply flavoured. And there's lots. 

My sandwich is a solid fress. A good amount of nicely spicy meat on textbook Jewish rye. It's salty and fatty and just slightly chewy where perfect hand-slicing might have yielded that buttery meltiness that defines outstanding smoked meat. hot mustard improves things. French fries are clearly home-made. Skinny and fried amber-brown. They're served in a metal cup alongside my sandwich, which lots of restaurants do these days; it's artsy presentation in a place that should be devoid of artifice, and it allows the crunch to steam right out of my potatoes. Coleslaw is properly vinegary but mostly cabbage. My Proustian ideal for coleslaw involves more carrot, green onion and parsley, and a closer balance between sweet and sour. 

But these are minor quibbles. I want Zelden's to succeed, and provide an option for deli fans. I think about my kids and the places and tastes that they will remember, and I hope good smoked meat makes the list. 

Zeli's used to sponsor a softball team in my old neighbourhood. So that's a thing, too.",2018-08-15 15:51:36,True,0.10148213500045038

I knew of the spot where they served Island food and some sushi rolls and now they've expanded to Chinese and All You Can Eat Sushi and Boba which is good for the Eastside.  

I skimmed through the Sushi menu and the Lisa Lisa roll caught my eye so I ordered that with the Seafood Combo (Mahi Mahi and Fried Shrimp) that came with one Meat choice (Short Ribs).

Lisa Lisa Roll is common in most sushi joints and I never really care for it but at this place I think what won me over is the ""crunch"" that was on top.  Something about it.  It was packed on tight on the top of the roll like.... packed snow.  Like fluffy ice!  That's what made it different from other sushi place, the fluffiness of the flakes.  It taste so good.  Plus, the ingredients in the roll look well proportioned.

As for the fish, shrimp and short ribs, it was okay.  Wasn't a fan of how the shrimp was fried because biting into it was super crunchy.  Let's compare it to Panda Express, it's crunchy batter around it but you get a tender bite of the shrimp and that's not what I got here.  More crunchy and an over cooked shrimp.  The short ribs and the Mahi Mahi was just ok for me.  The Mac Salad, I wasn't to impressed with.  It was a little runny for my liking.

As I waited for my to go order I quickly skimmed through their all you can eat sushi menu which looked decent enough to give a try.  Their AYCE menu is decent in price which I think matches what they serve.

The a go go roll has shrimp tempura inside, imitation crab and cucumber wrapped with shrimp topped with eel sauce.

But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

Pros: 
3 minutes away from my house..

Sushi was made pretty fast.

Flavor was good. I can say it's comparable to some of the other bigger AYCE. (At least the rolls I tried)

There is basically 3 restaurants in 1. You can order out of all 3 menus incase someone is not up for sushi. 


Cons: 
The place has 3 doors I believe and it can be pretty confusing, I went in through the door right under the sign that said Sushi house and it was a Sushi Bar. The sushi chef asked me if my order was for here or to go and I said here so he had me go down the hall into China a go go, once there I was just standing by the door and nobody greeted or seated me, I then went up to the counter and asked if I can just sit anywhere and he then sat me at a table, asked for our drinks .. I ordered my food, and while we were waiting we accidentally spilled some soy sauce, it was obvious the table had to be wiped but even after they brought us our drinks they did not offer napkins or wipe the table. 

The place needs more organization. More waiters maybe, I only saw one handling all tables for both restaurants. I'm sure once more waitresses are hired the above problems would take care of themselves.",2016-09-02 03:25:40,False,0.11374058987336214

I shop at this Yorkdale location once in a while when i see what i like. Usually not a great selection of shoes for men. 
But most importantly today, i had the most degrading experience from a sales rep/sale manager/loss control  :  Name Carlos.
I decided to go shopping with my family for mother's day celebration and tried on some shoe in the men's section, and after couple of tries, i found one that i liked. The lady that attended to me was really nice and pleasant. She promptly got my size from the back and we headed for cashing out. But as soon as Mr. Carlos saw me at the till, he came immediately to stand by the cash register to monitor the transaction, and once i paid with my debit card he left almost right away . So my question  for Holt Renfrew is this : do you always need a manager to stand by cashier when cashing out customers or did he decided to come and  monitor the transaction because I am black!!!  Is this your standard practice when it come to people of color or  Mr Carlos was just doing his job as a racist person. 1 really want some answers. 
After the sale, i confronted Mr. Carlos and ask him why he had to come monitor my transaction even though there were so many other transaction going on. He denied the accusation and lied that he was just there to get sales, even though the sale had been secured by the female rep.  My question again is that will he stand by the cash register to monitor all transaction , or just the black customers!!!  This looks like racism and discrimination to me to me and Carlos exhibited poor judgement.

Most times one goes and is rewarded with poor customer service, on the odd occasion, the service is impressive. It depends on the department you are shopping in. You can expect THE WORST from the shoe department. Where do I begin with my lament?
1) They are short staffed 5 days before a sale is about to start, who cares right? 
I do, you see, the sales associates call all their regular customers to come in and pre-buy the stock that is going on sale.( Please keep in mind that these are people that buy 2-3 pairs of shoes of $1000 + or more per pair at a time, as if they are buying a package of gum.) This is to ensure that the customer gets the shoe and size of their choice and the sale price to boot, before the actual sale, by using a very convoluted system that they have devised.
So why would a sales person want to serve me, and help me buy 1 pair of $1000+ shoes at regular price? IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COMMISSION!!

2) On my most recent foray into the shoe department of Holt Renfrew Yorkdale, I had a hard time trying to get a sales person to help my daughter and I , but I managed to find one, who would give us the time of day and help us.
The shoes that we came to buy were out of stock in my daughter's size, BUT we were told that we could pre-pay for the shoes and they would be in store for pick up within a week. That was on May 22, 2016. He even gave my daughter his cell phone number so that she could text him for ""updates"" These shoes were a well deserved birthday gift to my daughter from SEVERAL family members. She was excited and thrilled at the prospect of getting the shoes. I on the other hand was very nervous that she would not get the shoes, as you see IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COMMISSION!! None the less, we bought the shoes. Our transaction took a total of 15 minutes from start to end. Meanwhile, there were people, monopolizing a sales person from before we got there, during a wait for a sales person, and during our transaction, we left, while they were still trying on shoes and ""making a decision."" By my estimates that would be about 45 minutes of time being used WITHOUT A SALE, versus my 15 WITH A SALE.

3) Commission trick #2, sales person pre-sells a customer shoes for pick up in store, BUT when someone comes into the store on the day that the shoes have arrived, with cash in hand, willing to buy the same style of shoes, if the only size in the store that are available, are YOUR PREPAID SHOES, guess what? YOUR PREPAID SHOES get sold to that person, who NEVER HAD TO PREPAY OR WAIT. When you contact them to find out what is taking so long to get your shoes, you get  told a ""story"" about why your shoes are delayed.

4) Story #1---My daughter was told that her shoes had come in,  BUT! the wrong colour was in the box!! REALLY??? Give me a break. But in another 5 days, her shoes would come in (hmmm....probably sold her pair to someone else and re-ordered her size in again) Or she could buy the colour that came in??? Go ----yourself. No, she wanted what she originally PREPAID FOR

5) Story #2---That particular style is sold out company wide. It is a very popular shoe. The manager will talk to you about it.

6) Story #3--- Manager says, You can wait up to 3 weeks for the shoe and size to come in, or you can get a refund.  But, if you get a refund and re-purchase, then a $100 coupon that was used at the time becomes null and void and you can't use it toward the re-purchase of the shoes. When asked how a shoe could be in stock on day of purchase and PRE-PAYMENT and then suddenly out of stock,  my daughter was told that someone put the wrong colour shoes in the box that was sent to the YORKDALE store. (Don't BELIEVE a single word that you say). That would mean that at time of purchase there was only 1 pair of shoes in my daughter's size available company wide. If that was the case, we should have been informed as such. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE that was the case. 

My daughter opted to wait for the shoes in her size to come in. She has been texting the salesperson who sold her the shoes regularly for ""updates"" but what a surprise, he has stopped responding......

 Hmmm....the COMMISSSION plot continues....

Do yourself a favour, walk right by the shoe department in HOLT RENFREW YORKDALE, go elsewhere to buy your shoes, buy online if you have to! WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!! I'll pay more, if I have to, but I'll go where I'm treated better than here, and there are no COMMISSION GAMES being played.

As it stands, we are going to get a refund and get our shoes from Saks... so sorry. We are Canadian, and want to support a Canadian company. Why does it have to be so hard?",2016-06-08 13:25:03,False,0.09997481463087689

With three locations, one being downtown at Yonge and Bloor, another at Sherway Garden and this location in Yorkdale Mall, gives a variety of locations to choose from. Being located in one of the biggest malls in Toronto, you get to have other reasons to pay a visit to this store. 

The store consist of booths and boutique stores that will give a great focus on specific product lines. Having boutique stores such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Prada etc, will allow each store to display their very own look and brands the way they want to. Holt's main focus is to sell only and nothing but independent and high end brands from all over the world.

With valet parking and greeters, makes the store experience must more special as they would treat you with great honour. The staff is super nice and their service is super great. 

Every so often you'll catch a sale event that will give you crazy deals such as 70% off and hourly specials from specific boutique brands. if you can get to these, be ready for some fighting and shoving. With pricing being sky-rocketed, any sale that you can grab, take it. 

If hungry or thirsty during shopping then hit up the Holt Cafe for some grub. it's pricy but the food is more gourmet rather then the typical fast food. The bloor location is an actual restaurant but the Yorkdale location is more pre-made food. I would honestly just go to the mall and get your food from there if you're join to spend that much on food that you can get cheaper else where.

Nevertheless, you'll only need to go there to buy rare things unless you have a very serious problem and buy purses/shoes as much as you do with candy and coffee. But if you do want something fancy, pricey and elegant, then come here.",2015-02-02 05:35:47,True,0.09012666340248061

This holt renfrew is smaller than the one on bloor (obviously), and everything is quite easy to find. 
The bag section .. mmmm, makes me so happy and my wallet nervous. They offer basically every brand - givenchy, burch, kate spade, alexander wang, miu miu etc. They also have little individual 'boutiques' for the higher brands .. wait, then why does michael kors get one?
They also have a huge section for makeup. It's like a larger, cleaner sephora. 
The clothes section is also lengthy.. jackets, polos, shoes. You name it!

One bad thing.. there's a limited amount of 'genuinely nice' salespeople. I feel like there is a lot of pretentious snobby salespeople that see customers as another opportunity for commission. I've witnessed salespeople pointing and whispering while exchanging snobby and bitchy glances as each other as certain customers walk by. Maybe try to be a bit more subtle next time..

Yes, it's not as amazing as the Holt on Bloor but it's still Holts and that pink bag is as addictive as crack. I came here to get a birthday present and lo and behold, since I was actually BUYING something I received a lot of good customer service but maybe because it was that I was dressed in expensive clothes.
One time, I came in wearing jeans and runners, and received nothing but scathing looks from these sales associates. I was browing cashmere scarves and eau de toilettes. I had done my homework though and read reviews on the best ones and while I tried some scents that had been a big disaster for 2010, the knowledgable sales staff allowed me to try a new scent that was perfect, and had high reviews it wasn't too overpoweringly earthy\woody or aquatic either. 

After my card was declined, they were still kind and even kept up conversation until I called my bank and sorted everything out. Meanwhile, a second sales lady had wrapped everything up impeccably and added some extra samplers, smiling and talking about dinner and things of the sort. She was Italian and very kind, and the cashier was also very nice. The kind gentleman in the Armani winter section was so nice and helpful, completely unpretentious and understood I wasn't about to buy a $325 scarf. 

Other times I've come in looking for a handbag, the sales staff were snooty and I felt a bit intimidated but come in with confidence, believe you deserve the best and enjoy the experience--even if you don't buy anything. It's worth a visit while at Yorkdale and definitely rackets up the value of the mall. 

PS. The perfumes at Holt are a couple bucks cheaper than at Sephora--perhaps because Sephora gives out samples? Not sure if Holts does, but every time I ask they say (I roll my eyes here) they're out. 

I give this 3 stars because a) It's a Canadian store with some extremely drool-worthy brands and items

The makeup counters are always crowded, and on a busy weekend you'll probably have to wait to be served - if they bother to look your way. I save myself the grief and go to Sephora if they have the brand that I'm after. 

The designer accessories are plopped (and chained) onto the shelves and you have to hunt around for someone if you want something and then put up with their fake attempt to be genuinely interested in you. Since this is a smaller store their selection is somewhat limited.

Their shoe corner has a pitiful selection of Louboutin, Prada, Dior and Jimmy Choo's - but if you are really looking for shoes either head over to David's in the mall or go down to Holt's on Bloor St.

I have visited this particular Holt Renfrew location multiple times over the course of my entire shopping career. I think I've bought a total of one thing from here, which was a birthday gift for my mother back when I knew nothing about customer service and what it should be like.

Everyone that works here is so snotty, for no apparant reason. Well, I mean how could not be if you worked in a department store in a mall. Yeah...

You may be the keeper of the designer digs and $100+ cosmetics but I'm the one shelling out to overpay for this stuff so don't give me the attitude that you're better than me.

The set up inside is also terrible.

He looked great, his nails were short (they way they should be) and he smelled wonderful.  Did I mention he was happy? I'm sure that sometimes things go wrong, and while this service was just a bath, I will go back.

Also, just throwing this out there... Our other pooch has long hair and (as he has gotten older, oddly) a fairly thick undercoat. He is not a candidate to take to a groomer, but when he gets a matted area we cut it out immediately. I think people need to realize groomers aren't magic workers and there is upkeep we need to tend to on our pets an a regular basis.",2019-03-29 03:20:54,False,0.06208817290078372

I don't know if I have a standard yelp review on this but here it goes: place was great. I say was because it closed down just recently and they had the most memorable time with me there.

I started being their frequent customer at around 2018, so if anything for these guys they were the greatest PC LAN centers out there that doubles as an ESport place and has an overall great vibe into it.

If anything, it's all pros and barely any cons.

+ Great atmosphere with the galaxy theme
+ Humble shop owner
+ Stock of food and drinks
+ Great equipment
+ Tourneys were always fun here
+ They make you feel like you're in a second family with a pretty great community around it.

For any business owners out there that are going to establish a business like this, this is the standard. You have to fill in the shoes for these guys in the southwest region. You cannot compare this to Game Nest, Press Start Gaming, Evo Caf√© or any other E-sports shoppes out there.

I work with developmentally disabled adult that travels to Vegas and I basically get a mini vacation. As a California native, I don't have friends here and with all the down time, I try to do some gaming. I looked up if gaming PC bars were a thing in Vegas and I was pleasantly surprised to find Wolf and Lamb! I wanted to make sure of their policies, so I Facebook messaged them with my situation and they were very happy to accommodate my weird schedule. When I got there, I was greeted by Levi and he showed me around and I was very impressed with the vibe of the place. Galaxy paint, wall mounted tvs, consoles, rgb keyboards and mouses, bright nanoleaf lights to immerse you in the gaming mood. He place me in PC cubby he recommended cause it had the most space and reserved it for me in case I had to leave my disable client I was traveling with. He was very easy going, very helpful and very understanding of my weird work schedule and made sure I felt at home when I was 325 miles from my own. The PCs and peripherals were clean and the PCs build themselves were impressive. I was able to play games at 1080p 90-144 htz at high setting. I was there for PC gaming and was very satisfied. There are tournaments, memberships, board gaming, console gaming and snacks if you feel so inclined to snack. They deserve every amount of attention they get. They are very gamer and Levi made my trip so much more enjoyable. Please, do yourself a favor, come here. They deserve your money. COME TO WOLF AND LAMB PC.

Sat down for like 5 min and could no longer take the smell. It was just horrible body odor from the front to the back. Felt real nasty when I sat down too, chair felt sticky and the table the keyboard was on had crumbs around it. They should really give everything a good wipe after every user leaves the station. The service felt decent so I bumped it up to 2 stars, I wasn't really welcomed when I walked in but what do u expect from gamers I guess. I'm all for returning somewhere because of decent service but the smell inside needs to be fixed. I like to snack when I game so it cannot smell like dirty underwear inside at all. I think this place needs a temporary shut down for a real good deep cleaning. I'll pop back in again next week to see if they fixed this issue. I sure hope there 2019 smells better than this year.
As far as the rates, it was okay I guess. The employee told me it was the cheapest in town, that was a complete lie. Up the street there was a place that did $12 all day passes and $2 and hr specials for everyone, even non members. The rates for members up the street were $15 for an all day pass on a regular. This place is a close 2nd or 3rd for rates in town. At the risk of leaving more dirty and smelly than when you entered ID say they should let people play for half of what the competition charges. Or kick out the kids with bad body odor so they can feel embarrassed a little bit and start taking better care of themselves. 
Sorry, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't clean this place. It looked like it could be doing way better if they practiced cleanliness. They have all the bells and whistles, but no actively cleaning employees. New years resolution hopefully!

Upon arriving the person behind the counter was very nice and tried his best to explain to me how this LAN cafe works as I'm used to the traditional LAN cafes of just walking in and paying an hourly fee. However, here at Wolf and Lamb PC, it's quite different. It is almost like a tight knit community of gamers. The initial cost per hour for ""non members"" is $4 an hour and to become a member you pay a flat one time $10 fee to join, which drops your hourly rate to $3 an hour. However if you come here regularly or even purchase a monthly or weekly pass you automatically become a member.  Now what makes this LAN cafe different from the others? Well they have an official World of Warcraft guild that if you join your hourly rate gets dropped to $2 an hour. What if you don't play World of Warcraft? No worries! Each day they have a specific game genre that you can play at the cost of $2 per hour and sometimes it'll be free all day. On Mondays it's free to play fighting games only, on Tuesdays it's MOBA games, on Wednesday's it's family day so it's buy one hour get one hour free. Thursday's it's sports games and Fridays are tournament days and depending on the tournament you may not even have to pay. What's even better is that at the end of every ""season"" depending on what genre of game you play, for example a MOBA game like league of legends, each ranked game you win you'll get one point and whoever has the most point at the end of the ""season"" will earn a prize ranging from gift cards to game cards. They also have a streaming room for $8 an hour which includes a standalone microphone alongside a dual monitor set up and a green-screen. With today's generations of triple AAA titles like Call of Duty, you would need quite a powerful PC to run everything on max settings. After going through the main specs, it appears that all of the computers are prebuilt by a company I have never heard before but they all have a GTX 1070 and an i7700 which is pretty decent since the i7 7700 is about 3 years old and the 1070 is also about 3 years old but still a strong card. Some games I tested were Call of duty black ops 4, fortnite, and league of legends. All of them ran flawlessly at max settings. I did however turn off shadows in fortnite and black ops 4 as shadows tend to drop your frames per second (FPS) a lot and saw huge improvement when shadows were turned off. Another thing I liked was that the monitors are 144hz (the screen refreshes 144 times per second) which is great since 144hz monitors are basically the industry standard for gaming. If you're not into pc gaming that's totally fine, they have board games as well as a bunch of ps4's and Xbox one's with the latest titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2. They also have some previous generation consoles such as the Wii U, but they also have the Nintendo switch as well. Overall I'd say this place is a solid 4 out of 5. Reason being is the whole membership fees can be confusing as well as not having a manager on duty during my stay of at least 4 hours. One thing I would like to see is more computers and making the place more spacious as it can feel really tight if the place gets packed. Aside from that this is a really nice LAN cafe that is great to hangout with friends to play some Mario Games or compete in tournaments.

I was impressed with the services (first floor, near the lobby) I received last month (middle of the month), when I went to get my surety bond filed with the state and took my oath (notary renewal- every four years).

The clerk was nice and she seemed pretty experienced (she was good- Thank You!). I think the entire process was less than twenty minutes. I came here on a thursday morning (first thing), so maybe I got lucky. Either way, I was glad, that I was able to get it done without any snags.

There was a friendly security guard making his rounds. The lobby had a memorial for the 1 October victims- that was nice, very touching. For some reason, the light was not on in the lobby.

Second, it was our first visit to a brand new place. Perhaps a little coupon would be encouraged us to come back sooner and possible invite friends. There is a lot of competition in that area. A little buy one get one would've encouraged a faster return.

This is the second time I have ordered like this, and they were great about it both times.  This was 4 sides of lettuce, 2 sides of chicken, 1 side of meat, and one side each guac and sour cream.

5) Eggs that were fresh and cooked perfectly to order

6) The best corned beef hash of any diner we have visited to date. 

7) Real, made from scratch home fries with onions and green peppers cooked to perfection and basically indistinguishable from homemade. These are the absolute best Restaurant home fries my wife has ever had. 

7) Smoked bacon that I would guess came from a local butcher - again cooked perfectly. 

8) Toast that was not soggy, not served cold and with a nice selection of jams and jellies.

Another coworker got their pizza, in house. Completely undercooked. Breading was still soggy and not crispy at all. Again, flavour less. Frozen pizza from no frills is better, one thousand percent. Coworker finished half the pizza and couldn't eat anymore. That's how bad it was. 

For the prices your charging, completely unacceptable. Flavour less, portions were lack luster, and there's nothing that would bring me back other than the fact that they served ice cold water. God bless as I needed to rinse my mouth.

I usually enjoy my food to some extent but I've never been this disappointed ever. Wish I could have gotten a refund to be honest because I rather spend it on a hot dog for a fraction of the price with alot more umami that let's you enjoy your food.

Can I thank the gods of the 21st Amendment to the US Constitution that ultimately led to a time in space where we can experiment with chemistry and brew our own beer?

If you want to start brewing and have never done it before, you don't need to look any farther than here. They have starter kits with everything you could need for both small (1 gal) and large (5 gal) batch home brewing. There's a bucket, gallon jug, air lock, thermometer, hydrometer (both glass), bottle capper and sanitizing solutions. I'm probably missing something too. All you need to buy in addition would be the pot for boiling and some caps. Drink yourself a few beers and save the bottles for when you've made your own. Last but not least, you'll need a kit.

Here they prepackage several kits for different beer styles and get it all ready for you to simply grab and go. There are 1 gal and 5 gal batch options. I've bought the Irish Red (a good first-timer beer), Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest. There are at least 5 other types that I've seen. If you're more experienced or a bit of a traditionalist, you can even build your own recipe from scratch or online guides. They have buckets of bulk dry grains and malt you can scoop to your delight. If you're in need of supplies to increase your output, cooling time, measurements, for kegging, they've got just about everything here. Including, to my surprise, things for brewing wine and even sake.

The prices aren't bad, I guess.

Don't be fooled by its warehousey exterior and forbidding door that seems to lead to nowhere.  Inside is a veritable treasure trove of beer brewing and wine vintnering supplies, along with a staff of super-knowledgeable, passionate, and helpful employees.

I know next to nothing about brewing beer, but brewing equipment was my husband's Christmas wish, so I took me to the Alternative Beverage and said, ""Help!""  The guy who helped me hooked me up with a two stage brewing system, compiled all the equipment my husband would need, and sent me home with instructions and a three month buyer's club entitling my husband to 10% off any purchase.  Divine.

We went together to Alternative Beverage this past weekend for supplies for my husband's first batch, and the folks were equally helpful (despite a profusion of douchey dudes and their girlfriends, all milling around the front door... seriously, it looked like an entire group come straight from a full night at Pure and a brunch at Pewter Rose).

ANYWAY.  It's a great place to poke around, even if you know nothing about the brewing process.  I found a booklet about making my own vinegar.  Now that's something I can use!",2011-01-13 15:19:51,True,0.14705453046609904

Alternative Beverage used to be off South Blvd before the train happened - now, they're in an unassuming industrial space directly behind Sleepy Poet. Climb the steps, walk in, and you're in a warehouse full of everything you'd ever need to distill your own beer or wine. Kits for the inexperienced, barley etc by weight for those with the know, fruit concentrates, huge pots, carboys of several sizes, bottles of varying design, tubes, hydrometers, fridge of yeast and other fragilities, all sorts of fermentable insanity as far as the eye can see. Think Beer Brewing Mad Scientist's Secret Lair. They were a tad swamped on Saturday with only one dude working the register and the kid helping us and everyone else with questions, but they handled our confusion professionally and were obviously stoked to be selling us brewing equipment.

We ended up walking away with almost everything (the deluxe kit did not include a funnel, which we thought was odd) we need for less than we had saved, which was a rad surprise. They have a larger warehouse in Belmont but dude #2 told us that they have almost everything in the Charlotte store that ""that guy out there can get"".

We moved to Charlotte 2 months ago, and shopping for furniture was one of the first things we did.  We bought multiple rooms worth of furniture and spent many thousands of dollars at the store.  We waited 10 days for our first delivery.  The delivery guy says there is a part missing from our king sized bedframe and he can not put the bed together, so put the 4 huge boxes containing the bedframe in our garage.  Also the coffee table was not in stock, and the dining room table has a large chip right on the top.  He assures us he will let the company know, and that they would call me.  Several days go by (over new years holiday,  so I gave them a few days before calling).  I call customer service, and they tell me the delivery guy did'nt report anything, and they would resend the furniture.  The next week-same delivery guy comes and drops off the coffee table.  He sees the boxes still in the garage and laughs, saying oh I see they still have'nt fixed your stuff.  He quickly leaves, and I notice the entire corner of the table is crushed and broken in several spots.  I run out to the front of my house, and flag the guy down to take back the broken piece, and he gets in his truck and ignores me, then leaves.  I call customer service again, and again reschedule yet another delivery.  Another week goes by and a new delivery crew arrives.  They do not have the dining room table.  They inspect the bedframe boxes and say there is nothing missing, that it is likely that the first guy did'nt feel like putting it together, and that he has done this before.  They brought a new bed and put it together, but the footboard is damaged.  They checked the one in the garage, and it also is damaged.  They brought another coffee table, which was fine.  I am livid at this point about the first delivery guy and the continued deliveries of broken and missing items. I call the store, I called customer service multiple times.  I told them if they sent this driver to my home again, that I was not letting him in.  I was assured that my chart would be ""red flagged"", and a supervisor would call me by the end of the day.  No one ever called.  I called both back the next day, and scheduled delivery number 4.  On this delivery, the damaged bed frame was replaced, and the delivery guy tells me that the first time, it was not put together correctly and we are lucky it did not break.  They brought another dining room table-this one had a huge amount of damage.  They showed it to me on the truck and did not bring it in my home.  Calls again to customer service, where I'm told they will send someone to fix the chip instead.  Several more days go by, and a man comes bright and early at 8am on a Saturday.  He is in my home for seconds, and tells me they dont repair table tops because it is too noticeable, takes a picture, and leaves.   He asks if I told them where the chip was, as it is their policy to never attempt to repair a table top (and yes they were well aware it was on tabletop).  I call the manager at the store again, he is on vacation.  I am told there is another manager who will call me back in a few minutes.  He never calls.  I call customer service and somehow wind up talking to a supervisor and have set up a 6th delivery to my home for next week.  The people in the store were very nice, and the undamaged pieces are nice.  Their customer service, follow through, and delivery are horrendous!

My experience after I walked out of the store was TERRIBLE. I will NEVER buy from Rooms To Go again. It was awful. After waiting almost 2 weeks to get my couch, the delivery people forgot the legs to the ottoman. They told us they would overnight the legs when they got back to the warehouse and that they were easy enough for us to install or we could set up a service appointment once we got the legs. This was a Friday and they delivered just before 5pm so I figured they wouldn't get the legs sent out Friday so I waited a few days (until Wednesday) and still no legs. I called the Customer Care Center and they made it out to be my fault that I didn't call to tell them the legs weren't delivered. They said that there was no note on my account that the legs were missing and that the delivery people can't ship parts, let alone overnight them. I don't know how I was supposed to know that since this is my first purchase from Rooms To Go. So then they say it will be 5-7 business days for the legs to get to me. The time of this phone call is now 5 days after the furniture was delivered. I was so mad and let them know. I then called this Rooms To Go location to talk to them because I was upset. They said that they will take the information and forward to a Customer Care Center Supervisor and that the supervisor would be calling me by the end of the day (which was still Wednesday). I never got a call. I called back to the Customer Care Center Thursday afternoon and asked why someone didn't call and they said they didn't receive the request from the store! They did say that my legs were sent out that morning (Thursday) and would be arriving to me on Friday. I called the store to figure out why they hadn't forwarded the request and they said that they did. They also told me that the legs wouldn't arrive until Saturday. RIght there, conflicting information. Well, the legs FINALLY showed up Saturday at 5:15pm (ish). We couldn't install them ourselves like the delivery guys had said because we don't have the right tool to do so. So I called the Customer Care Center again. Well they close at 4:30pm on Saturday (8 days after the furniture was delivered) so then I had to wait until Monday to even be able to schedule the service request for the legs. So I call Monday. They say the FIRST day they can come is Thursday (which is Christmas Eve and 13 days after the furniture was delivered). I agreed since I had no other option. Then on Wednesday, I got a text and 3 phone calls to let me know that the 4 hour window was 9am-1pm. I'm also told the tech will call prior to arriving. So Thursday morning comes around, no phone call the guy shows up. Fine. I let him in and he says that about 90% of his service calls are for ottomans not having the legs. He was in my house for 3 mins. 3 MINUTES!! Yet I had to wait. I called the Customer Care Center to just tell them how disappointed I was and all they had to say is that they will note the account. NEVER ONCE did they apologize. Some of the WORST customer service I have EVER received. I also sent an email to Customer Service and their only response was that the legs were scheduled to be installed. No sorry for your inconvenience, no let me do something to make it up to you, nothing. It was like I deserved this all along. I spent $89.99 on delivery and it was a joke. By the time my couch was completed, it had been 3 and a half weeks since I bought it and it was completed the MORNING of Christmas Eve. Hours before I had a house full of people.

They put half of the bed together and while they were doing that the 3rd driver tried to take the desser off the truck by himself. I heard a crack from the kitchen I thought to myself they are going to tell me there's a scratch, Scratch was an understatement. The whole top of the dresser came apart and the screws were coming up. The driver says you can keep the dresser and we will order another one. I said to him are you crazy I should leave a broken dresser in my 8 year olds room to get hurt, No I am refusing it. Also they did not have the Canopy for my baby's bed, 2 strikes. So I called the store. The sales person tells me I have to come to the store to redo the paper work for the financing.

(Yes, I know Yemen is not on the Mediterranean, but they do have hummus and shwarma and falafel, and I think the spice palette is similar.

The decor is non-existent.  Nothing hanging on the walls.  But they do have tables, and also an area that appears to be more traditional seating (remove your shoes, sit on the floor with pillows).  We didn't see anyone using the traditional area, so we weren't brave enough to go there (and perhaps violate some custom or tradition).  Maybe that area is for private parties??  Don't know.

As others have commented, traditional music streams out of the kitchen area.  I didn't understand a word of it, but it does help create the atmosphere of an African or Middle Eastern cafe.  I liked it for that reason.  American top 40 would have clashed, as it always done when one is in an ethnic restaurant, in my opinion.  Kudos to them for keeping it authentic.

You can order at the cashier or at the table. The food came out super fresh and super delicious. Traditional music was playing the whole time which was cool. 

I love going to ME places especially Mandi restaurants; they remind me so much of Dubai! 

This was a great experience. I'm glad we came here for lunch today! So yummy! 



Isn't it great when you find food from Yemen all the way in the valley? I sure felt glad! 
Having lived in Dubai all my life, I grew up fond of this kind of food, Mandi, Mathbi, Madfoon, Bukhari, etc. Yemeni and Saudi food in Dubai was and still is very popular and is known for delicious taste, huge portions, and very reasonable (sometimes even cheap) prices. 
We were referred to this restaurant by a family member. Not sure how she found out about it bcz she never tried it so far but we, my husband and I, decided to give it a shot and head there. We arrived at around 12:45pm. We expected to find some people when we walked in but it was empty. Not a problem. The first thing that I would say is probably the only major negative in this place is the smell. My husband was about to take me some where else bcz I was getting uncomfortable. As you walk in, you are hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals that do not smell good at all. I am not sure what the reason is but I decided to just ignore the smell and order and go in as soon as possible bcz the smell was mostly only at the entrance. 
I ordered the goat mandi and my husband ordered the lamb with rice dish. We were asked to pick a seat either on the table or in the traditional Arabic section and they would bring out the food. We also were offered to get our drinks from the fridge. 
We decided to sit in the Arabic Jalsa area since there was no one there. The food came out in a reasonable time - about 10 min and it looked great. The meat was in the center of the dish with some browned onions on top, both dishes looked very inviting. The food was served with a lime wedge, some cucumber yogurt and a green chili sauce on the side. We dug in and the food was delicious! I was so glad at that point that my husband did not insist on making us leave and that I was able to survive the entrance and try this good food. The meat was delicious and very tender and the rice was cooked to perfection. Portion size as always in these restaurants was just right. Having not had breakfast, I finished my dish and of course my husband did too. 
After eating this great meal we left feeling drowsy lool, a typical feeling after you have such a good big rice meal  
We paid at the entrance just before we left and the price was $39 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks. Slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. 
I hope they will find a solution for the smell in this place because the food and the service are so good, it would be a shame if ppl decide not to come in because of that.",2018-08-25 23:19:41,True,0.1458141525691394

We stumbled across the postings for this place, and as we had never had Yemeni food before, we thought that it would be ideal.  YS Restaurant is located on the Northeast corner of Rural Road and University Drive in Tempe, Arizona, right near Arizona State University.  There is a parking lot on that corner behind the buildings that line the intersection of Rural and University that abuts the restaurant entrance.

Having read the previous Yelp reviews, we knew the drill for this establishment.  On our way in, we snagged menus off the counter before seating ourselves at a booth.  There was an area in the front of the restaurant where one could sit on the floor on cushions in the traditional Arab-style, but we really didn't feel like being that authentic.  Drinks were in two refrigerated cabinets, and I walked over and picked out soft drinks for the two of us.

When the very nice and helpful young lady who was behind the counter came over to take our order, we were ready.  She asked if we had any questions about the food, but we had already made up our minds.  Mom decided to have the Lamb Shank, and I went for the Goat Meat.  The entrees were ready very quickly, and she brought them right out to us.

Goat is a rich and slightly unctuous meat, a bit like Oxtail, with bones like the latter for which one has to watch out.  Here it is served on a generous bed of Yemeni-seasoned Basmati rice with two sauces, an Arab form of Tzatziki and a chili-spiced hot sauce.  It flavour was simply delicious.  Mom was equally pleased with her Lamb Shank.  It was falling-off the bone, and she noted that it was some of the tenderest lamb that she had ever tasted.  When we talked to the young woman again after the meal, when she was, also, kind enough to snap a photo of both of us, she told us that the lamb was cooked for three to four hours and that some of the spices for the rice were imported all the way from Yemen itself.

All in all, our first experience with Yemeni food was a great one.  This feeling seems to have been shared with the Middle Easterners who were eating there, too, who appeared to be enjoying their meals whilst dining in the Arab manner.  We were especially pleased that the proportions of the delicious rice and the meat were enough to merit bringing some home in a doggie-box in order that we could have another meal later.  If you live or are visiting up in the Phoenix area, YS Restaurant is definitely worth a visit.",2018-05-17 08:07:26,False,0.10200648358703791

I love how Tempe is growing to be a community of different backgrounds and cultures, and no greater manifestation of this can be shown by the food that is offered here. I had never had cuisine from Yemen before so I was excited to go on a food journey and try some dishes. The restaurant itself is very nondescript and the overhead signage simply says ""Restaurant"". The name of the restaurant is plastered on the front glass walls and on a sidewalk sign though. 

The interior is similarly nondescript, with tables and booths in the front although there does look to be a nice area in the back where people can sit on cushions and eat on a low table. The menu offers various Middle Eastern dishes you will find at other restaurants such as falafel and shawarma but also has a few unique offerings you won't find elsewhere in Tempe. After finding out that  fahsa/salteh (Lamb stew) was the national dish of Yemen, I knew I needed to try it out!

It arrived scorchingly‚Äã hot, so I needed to wait a bit for it to cool down before trying any. I ended up trying a few bites of falafel, hummus and rice from my husband's plate while I waited. I found the to be hummus smooth and creamy, the falafel crisp on the outside with a good texture and flavor on the inside, and the rice to be soft and well seasoned. The stew was so good; I can see why it would be called the national dish! It was bold and spicy, yet had a comforting homey feel to it from the slow cooked, soft lamb to the thick rustic broth. It was served with some pieces of pita. 

Note that they don't seem to offer any glasses of water. All the water is by the bottle in 2 drink cases to each side of the counter. There is also a selection of American and Middle Eastern sodas to choose from. When I asked if they offered cups of water the cashier said they did but when the server dropped off our food and I asked for a cup of water he brought me a bottle of water. 

Our server also neglected to give us any silverware for our meal which I had to remind him to provide to us. Service in general was genial though and we were checked up on as needed. 

That lamb stew was so good I'd definitely be back to try more Yemen style cuisine. In my opinion, definitely say Yes to YS!",2017-04-18 14:16:14,True,0.11488334325614218

Both come as a generous platter of seasoned rice along with a fair amount of perfectly cooked meat, some caramelized onions, refreshing yogurt sauce, and some zhug (Yemeni hot sauce).
I must begin with the rice. It was quite possibly the best rice I've ever had. A myriad flavors, subtle and pronounced, joined together on my palate. I normally don't like spicy food, but this rice was just barely spicy, just enough so that it tickled my tongue in a most pleasant way. Come here for the rice if nothing else.
The meat is very tender, and an excellent complement to the rice. For the goat, it was falling off the bone.
The zhug was far too spicy for my occidental sensibilities, so I cannot give suitable feedback where it's concerned. However, the yogurt sauce was a cool, welcome contrast.

It any toy ends with a 0 it is not half off. I didn't need any toys, but I never go in the shop without purchasing something whether I need it or not.

She called someone from the back to verify. Sure enough they agreed the toy was not half off, she also mentioned that no toys ending in a 0 or 00 was half off.

They stood at the bar for five minutes and were never even acknowledged. We got sat in a booth and didn't have anyone come talk to us for another 10 minutes.

Drinks took way too long...first the pop, wait, wait, then two beer, wait, wait, then the kids drink. The pop was nearly flat but I should have appreciated it more since I wasn't offered a refill for the rest of the dinner. At this point the wait for the food began...and we waited...and we waited. No acknowledgement from our server, no manager coming around. Finally we asked and were told our meals would be another 15 - 20 minutes because they'd had too many takeout orders that night. Wha?? So we wait some more. Our food comes out - all except my husband's meal. The server says he's trying to track it down...huh? Another five minutes. Server comes back, says it was given to another table (?) and they were making him another one. So he had nothing to eat the entire time we ate our meals. It finally came and was delivered without any sort of an apology.

Being a restaurant that focuses on steaks and ribs, you would assume that they have become quite good at cooking them. Unfortunately, this is not the case at Montana's. When I was there last, they did not even have any beef ribs as they had sold out of them. Instead I got the rib eye steak which was a very poor cut of meat. The steak itself was cooked to my preference but the fat was impossible to cut through with the very dull steak knife I was provided. Some of the people I was with got the pork ribs and found them to be extremely dry and cold when served. The restaurant was busy, but they also took far longer than they should have to cook the food. The service was also quite spotty but good when they around. I don't understand why the prices are so high in Montana's in comparison to similar restaurants.

I got out of a late movie and was craving some nachos. I hadn't been to Montana's in over 3 years and it's not my #1 choice. But it was close by, so we decided to just go there. It was a Thursday evening, so the restaurant was only a quarter full and we were sat pretty quickly. The menu said that the only nachos they had were ""Pulled Pork Nachos"". I like pulled pork, so I decide to settle for those even though I wanted just plain nachos. We also decided on a caesar salad to share and deep fried pickles. We promptly put in our order, and that was probably the most service we received all night. We saw several staff members walking around, chatting and ignoring customers. It seems to me that Montana's tends to hire really young servers (barely 18 I think) that don't give a crap about their job. 
The food took almost 40 minutes to arrive. The starter caesar salad was pretty disappointing. It was extremely small (small even for a starter), and looked like that bagged iceberg lettuce from Safeway with bacon bits and Renee's Caesar Salad Dressing. I could make that at home, and do a way better job too. The deep fried pickles were alright, but the batter was a bit thick. The worst was the Pulled Pork Nachos. There was barely any cheese on the nachos, and it wasn't even melted cheese. The pulled pork was disgustingly sweet, almost like they were sitting in maple syrup for a week. It made the nachos taste awful. 
I tried to flag down the server, but had no luck. So, unfortunately, I was so hungry that I ate around the horrible pulled pork as best I could. That was the theme of the service all night. As soon as we placed our order, we didn't see our server again until we were done eating. Our drinks had been sitting empty for a while, and she asked if we wanted more drinks as she was bringing over our bill. Since I work in the service industry, I still tipped her, though not nearly as much as I usually do because of her nonexistent service.

Great learning experience for him but now I drive away with a clunk clunk coming from my front wheels, awesome. They of course plead ignorance but it comes in with no noise and leaves with a noise.

I trusted him like I trusted my uncle. He even kept my car for two weeks when it had a fuel leak and was a fire hazard. I probably owe him my life for that.

Back in the 70s, the lady was just a little girl entering Vesta with her 6 siblings and father. They just arrived in Canada and Vesta was becoming their morning routine. She remembered how her father would proudly tell others that the 7 kids were his and it was there that she had eggs for the first time as breakfast. It just wasn't a breakfast item where she was from. 

When she explained how later she would call back home to her father to tell him that she now worked at this tiny diner, there was so much heart found in her voice. Her father, Canada as her new home and eggs for breakfast all become rooted in Vesta. The lady hopes to continue cooking there for a long time.

Another visit:  this time I walked out without even being served.  SO disappointing after walking all the way there.   NO consistency in this place.

.............................................................

Please don't think me too fickle, but my most recent trip there was good.  The cook was nice and didn't mind my 10 requests for how I specifically wanted my breakfast prepared.

The breakfast was good.

...........................................

Below is how much I didn't like the servers the last time I was there:


This place has gone DOWNHILL!

In the past, it's been nice for a greasy bacon and egg breakfast - but the hacks working there now just aren't cut out for serving food.

I don't want to insult the rotund woman serving the food - but they need to widen the space behind the counter because she can't walk behind the counter without bouncing off it frequently and knocking things over on the serving counter.

And she is rather clueless as a server.  I didn't get the Coke that I asked for, and no Ketchup for the fries.  No toast.  It sat waiting to be toasted after she asked if I wanted brown bread or white.  And then - when I was done eating, and pushed my plate to the side and wanted to get the cheque - she just kept walking past me and walking past me and ..... ..... .....

And it would be nice if the cook did a little better timing his preparation.  I asked for fries for the second breakfast I ordered (OK - call me a pig) - because I couldn't stomach more than one bite of their pitiful excuse for fried potato mush (I guess they call that crud home fries or something - but it's about the most mushy, soggy, luke warm excuse for such a thing you'll ever see).  I mean that mess was WORSE than your usual crude they reheat to go with bacon and eggs.

But my mistake asking for fries meant that the rest of my food got cold sitting on a plate after the cook took the eggs and bacon off the grill to wait and wait and wait for the fries.

So the eggs and bacon arrive cold.  Thanks.

And the grunge in this place!!!!

Little flies sticking to a sign that hasn't been cleaned in years - and you don't - I mean you DON'T want to see the handle of their frying pan or the block they use to clean off the grill.

Some genius has taken rope of some kind and wrapped it around the handles on those two tools - and the handles are a disgusting grease soaked grungefest.

I wasn't feeling too hot at 11:30 at night after a slight bout of food poisoning a few days prior and had just begun to get my appetite back after eating nothing all day. I wasn't too keen on consuming anything too heavy so I figured I'd call the restaurant which, according to its awning, has had a pretty good reputation for 60 years.

""Hi there,"" I said as my stomach growled in the background. ""Do you guys have chicken soup?""

""Our soup of the day is lentil,"" a kindly female voice replied. 

""Bummer. Well I wasn't feeling very well and was looking for something light to fill me up because I have been ill. Thanks for your time anyway.""

I was about to hang up when the kindly female voice assured me that she would indeed make chicken soup from scratch and that I should stop by in a half an hour. 

Surprised at such magnanimity, I hung up the phone with famished bemusement.

At midnight I walked in and introduced myself. 

""Hello there,"" I said as I extended my hand with gratitude and humility. ""I was the one who called and requested the chicken soup.""

A slight woman with short grey hair grabbed my hand and with a smile that could warm the heart of someone with the most frigid of demeanors said, ""I'm Miriam and I treated you and made this soup as if you were one of my own children."" 

Needless to say it was the best chicken soup I ever had and when I called her back 20 minutes later after finishing the entire container I told her so. 

It was so good in fact and I was so touched by her effort that I said that I was going to sign up for Yelp and write a review because the world needs to know that kindness and culinary expertise are not mutually exclusive.

So I hope you have enjoyed my first official yelp review dear reader. Never has a woman like Miriam or her place of employ - Vesta Lunch deserved it more.

2. Not the cleanest place I been too, i noticed it has a weird odour as your sitting waiting for your food.

4. There is a older white male as a chef in there  who is in his 50's and does NOT look clean at all.

It's down the road from me so if I am walking past on my way home from a night out then it seems like a good idea, but it usually isn't. I tend to order things like sloppy burgers with homefries and it always tastes like the most amazing food given my state, but in reality I know it's probably not. The homefries tend to be undercooked and this concerns me when it comes to eating anything meat-based. But at least it's cheap and all the drunks sitting along the tiny counter are likely thinking the same thing.

The place is absolutely tiny. You walk in and hope it's not crowded because I can't imagine what it would be like when things are standing room only. I imagine you would have to wait outside for your order. I recommend getting take-out because you really don't want to spend more time in here than you have to.

I'll start with the good:

1. I was able to check in at 930am. I'm going to count that as a BIG plus because not many hotels allow that. However, I was flying from ottawa to Calgary direct and with the time change I got there super early. They quickly checked me in and it was awesome because I was exhausted and didn't want to wait around until 3pm for a room. 

2. The staff is super friendly - they treated me great and made sure I had what I needed when I asked for it. They also quickly changed my room when I had a concern. 

3. The bar is nice and the bartender was very friendly. The sad part, the close early. Like 10pm. 

The bad: 

1. The motor in the AC of my first room was broken and I had to ask them to please switch me to another room. They tried to send someone to fix it while I was there but that was a failure. Lol 

2. The second room I was in, the AC was ""working"" but it barely cooled. I was lucky if I got a tiny bit of cold air. It was so hot that I had to sit next to the AC to be cool enough to do my makeup. 

3. The fridge wasn't even plugged in and I had to fight with the fridge and pull it out to find the plug. 

4. You don't get your room cleaned unless you ask them to do it. Ok fine, I left at 9am and asked them to please have my room cleaned by 2pm because I would be back with company and then needed to get ready. Sadly, I got back at 3pm and my room was still not cleaned up. I had to call down. The front desk had forgotten to relay my message. Sigh! So if you are going to ask us to request a service in order to provide it, the least you can do is make sure you send the message over to housekeeping. 

5. The beds are super uncomfortable and old. The entire hotel is old. The rooms are not that great and the balconies are open for use but you cannot smoke outside. So, don't bother calling down to ask hehe! 

6. The shuttle needs to be scheduled ahead of time, so if you are at the airport you are SOL trying to get a ride. However, when I called the week before to ask about this they told me it wouldn't be a problem. Then when I tried to use the shuttle it wasn't available . Anyway, long story short.

I arrived here on Monday, 8/24/2015, the tail end of my short trip to Alberta, Canada. The Clarion hotel conference centre-Calgary Airport is one of those budget friendly hotels that caters to just about anyone: from the business traveler, to single travelers, couples, and families who want to sightsee in Calgary and beyond. The price point per night is roughly on the cheaper end: $70-$100 a night, which can be a great thing for budget minded travelers - like me. Here at the Clarion hotel conference centre - Calgary airport, it's pretty much a catch all in terms of what you want to do during your stay in Calgary. Whether you're passing through or planning an elaborate vacation, the Clarion Hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport can be your solution to your next big fling. For me, it was a place to rest my head before flying home. The proximity to Calgary airport from the Clarion hotel was about 5km, so it wasn't too bad at 4am - although finding a petro station that early near the airport terminal proved to be a challenge! Overall, my stay at the Clarion hotel and conference center was indeed a nice and satisfying one. 

If you are ever in the area and need a budget friendly and centralized place that's close to the airport, you should consider coming and staying here at the Clarion hotel & conference centre at Calgary airport. I received room 408 for the night of 08/24/2015 and didn't bother to ask for a wake up call for a 6:45am flight the next morning. The lobby was pretty nice and there was plenty of free parking around the complex. This Clarion hotel is location at 2120 16th Avenue NE and there are several restaurant options nearby. The lobby was nice and everything looked orderly, just empty. They accept major credit cards, so that's always a plus. The check in process was really good and fast. The service was quite good and the person who was checking me in had a smile on her face. That made me feel pretty good about my upcoming stay that night. After getting my room key, getting to the room was just an elevator ride to the 4th floor. 

The room itself was typical of any 2 star hotel room you would find anywhere in Canada and the USA. Everything was working, including the shower and television. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable, although I slept on one of them. Getting a room with a double bed was nice, but with a free night stay from Hotels.com, who am I to argue with free? I probably got 7 hours of sleep that night before checking out of the hotel and headed out to the airport for an early morning flight back to the USA and eventually home. For what it's worth, the Clarion Hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport is more than just a hotel that's in close proximity to the airport for those who need to be close to it for a quick entrance or exit.   Too bad it was just for a night here, otherwise, I'd be discovering more places in Calgary. If you are in the area and need a place to stay without breaking the bank, consider the Clarion hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport.

Comfortable stay and I would consider returning here, if my itinerary permits me to do so. Well worth it.

So we went down to the front desk to wait another hour for another room. At about 5pm, two hours after the hotel check-in time, we just accepted another room with a queen and couch instead of 2 queens. 
The room was very clean which I was happy about, until we came back the next day after housekeeping had ""cleaned"" the room.

I immediately called the front desk who had the cleaning supervisor come and tell me that she was part of the crew that cleaned my room, but that she cleaned the bathroom only.  She said that this has never happened before.

The night manager spoke to me as well and repeated that they've never had an incident such as this.  I can say that in my 20 years of traveling I've never had items stolen from my room either.  The hotel's ""investigation"" was that their interrogation of the room lock showed the only access to be from the maid and from myself when I returned in the evening.  They accepted no responsibility for either hiring thieves who took items or for someone's incompetence at leaving my door open for someone else to steel my property.  Too bad like better hotels they have no cameras in the hallways for security.

This place got a new sign ""SHAWARMA"" which lead me to try it out.  Stouffville doesn't have any shawarma so we were excited to give it a try.

What a mistake that was.  The guy making the shawarma had no idea what he was doing.  It was almost like it was his first time making a shawarma.  Who puts tahini and garlic sauce on the bread before anything else?  Never seen that done.  As well what kind of Greek place doesn't have hummus??  He didn't know how to wrap the shawarma either and it was all coming apart.  He had to hold it with his hand and a lid while grilling it so everything didn't fall out.  

On top of that it was terrible to taste, the ingredients were all terrible and nothing tasted fresh.  The meat was even cold inside.  Definitely the worst shawarma I've ever had in my life and I've had hundreds.  I wouldn't even call this a shawarma, just a sad attempt at making one.  

I also asked for a Greek salad.  I can go to a Pakistani restaurant and I'm sure they know how to make me a Greek salad.  You can go anywhere in the world and they know what the hell a Greek salad is.  Apparently not everywhere, this place which is called GREEK STOP doesn't even know what a Greek salad is.  Who puts diced tomatoes, shredded carrots and green peppers in a Greek salad??? WTF is that??  I thought maybe it will taste OK so I took it anyway.  The dressing was disgusting and we threw the entire thing out.  

This place is a complete waste of time and money and I would never go there again and hope they soon close down and save themselves more embarrassment.  I've never in my life actually wanted to go back somewhere to ask them to taste it themselves so they can see what they are serving people.

I used to enjoy coming here but I think I was really only supporting this place because it was the only Greek place I knew in the area.

The daily specials aren't really a deal at all and they still cost you $10. Also, the place isn't really in the best ""repair"" greasy looking floors and you'll often find the guy behind the counter just sitting on his phone or one time sleeping in the booth. 

The food itself is okay, but they don't give you nearly enough meat, and like most Subway Franchise owners are misers when it comes to toppings and extra stuff, literally counting the amount of diced tomatoes or pickles or radishes they include. That's a terrible attitude for ingredients and it reflects poorly on the restaurant. It also gives me the impression that despite the low amount of traffic, they don't care about giving the customer a good experience.

The tongs they use might as well be tweezers. Oh and I asked for some tzizki sauce and he told me he had to charge me an extra $0.75 for a spoon of it. Pathetic. 

Would I come back? Maybe. If they dropped prices in half.

Edit: I've gone back to this place and instantly regret it. If you want food that'll keep you alive, then this is the place you can go when youve tried pizza sub sandwiches and cheap Chinese.

I've been to this restaurant before, just never reviewed it. My previous trips were fabulous and on point. As soon as you set foot in the door, you are enrobed in the glorious aroma of  BBQ smoked meaty goodness. You can smell it blocks away. It even makes this vegetarian salivate! 

Maybe it was the sign outside the door that said ""Cook Wanted"" that should have raised the red flags. But, hunger always wins and on our way inside my husband and I went. 

We were seated promptly, though it took awhile to even get a drink. Our salad and appetizer of BBQ brisket flatbread came out about 15 minutes later. It was tasty but undercooked. After about 20 minutes into putting our order in for the BBQ brisket dinner and a mashed potato pizza, we were informed that the pizza oven wasn't working. It was taking a long time because it had to be made in the regular oven. A solid 35 minutes into waiting and then watching the people who came in after us get served before us, my patience was nil. 

The pizza finally arrived, at the 40 minute mark. Of course it was a soggy mess. The brisket dinner was room temperature, with hot beans for good measure. I sent the pizza right back, only to be told that ""the pizza oven was now working"". The waitress really could have kept that fact to herself at that point. Sorry your kitchen staff can't get it together. We promptly packed up our food and left. The pizza was taken off the bill, but nothing else was comped in any way. 

Now, I could have stuck around and raised a big stink, got the manager involved, blah, blah. But honey, after the crap shoot of a day I had, I just didn't have the energy to feed more vampires. All I wanted to do was go home. 

So, in conclusion, Smoke really, truly does have amazing BBQ foods. They are worth checking out. I'll give them another chance somewhere down the distant road. And I'll be sure to ask if their pizza oven is working before I order.",2018-05-25 02:55:19,True,0.08092967005247213

This place always had a great lil vibe - good beans, solid corn dusted breads, interesting and tasty specials like the pulled pork pasta and the yummy appetizers - I hope whatever changed changes back as I hate the thought that I go pay to pick up BBQ just to come home and slather it in Sweet Baby Rays or some Memphis style sauce...it shouldn't need it.  

I will def give it one more shot as we've had many great meals here one can be off but I am seeing other reviews that mention a change of ownership...that makes me wonder if this was a fluke or if my days picking up SMOKE are numbered.",2018-04-28 21:53:40,True,0.08151869709012169

Pulled pork sandwich had no - NONE - smoked flavor.  My 24 year old son said it was like someone found some meat and threw a little BBQ sauce on it.  His words:  WORST BBQ I'VE EVER EATEN.

Husband has the same dinner - said it was flavorless.

My full rib dinner - well the biggest potato I think I've ever seen.  Asked for more butter & sour cream which never came.  Girl did offer more ice tea several times.  I think It was the water - it did not taste right.  It wasn't bad - on its way out - but was not right.  Am not sure what was wrong with it.

The ribs - the meaty part of the bone was tough and did not ""fall off the bone""  you tugged to get  it.  Burned top - seemed like they were cooked and BBQ and ready to serve and then through back k on the grill to warm with more sauce. 

Meal was rushed - sat down; got the tea, served my salad and before I was 1/3 of the way done with the salad the meal was served.

I did not say anything that night, Saturday 7 April, 2018 because my son does not like that I do.  I have to inform you - perhaps you don't know what's going on in the kitchen.  

My son won't go back.  He said after paying over $60.00 to take us to BBQ - he could have stood in the yard and just burned the money.  Same effect.

I'm sorry to have to say his words - but that's how it is.  THANK YOU.

Been here quite a few times and it was always good. Today, was a different story. Took forever to get drinks. I chalked that up to it being very busy, which I thought was a good sign. The pulled pork egg rolls we ordered as appetizers were really bad. The few pieces of pulled pork that were inside tasted like they've been around for a few weeks. And the rolls themselves were chewy and greasy. The coleslaw that came with it as garnish tasted like it came out of a cooler that lost its power a while back.

The interior of the restaurant hasn't changed since the the first time I visited in the 90's (then a pizza place by the name of Mr. P's), so that was a bit of nostalgia I enjoyed.  And that was where the fun ended.

I ordered The Roast Beast, which is essentially a French Dip, and macaroni and cheese with bacon for an additional upgrade.  The sandwich was presented on a sesame seed hamburger bun, which was unimpressive, but the absolute lack of taste was the deal breaker.  It had none.  The meat was bland, there was hardly any (shredded) cheese on the sandwich, and the au jus tasted like it was made by boiling ten gallons of water and adding in one beef bullion cube.  The macaroni and cheese was orange, and clearly not made from real cheese.  It looked a bit like Kraft mac and cheese, but had even LESS taste.  I would have been more satisfied with Kraft.  

Worst restaurant food ever, and I'm no food snob.  I prefer literally everything I've ever had in any kind of restaurant establishment, even fast food, over this place.  If you're stuck in that particular area, the food at the convenience store/gas station right next door (RediGo) is better.  By a lot.

My friend liked the riblets she ordered, but I left feeling like I flushed $30 down the toilet.

We shared a bowel of the Brunswick stew & both got the combo platters so we could have a sampling of the different meats/sides. The stew was very good, sweet but very layered in flavor and hearty.

We had the bacon mac & cheese- very cheesy and good. The fries- good seasoned with rosemary, huge amount, the baked beans- good tasting, but a little on the dry side and the slaw- this  was a let down, definitely tasted like GFS coleslaw, which I like but not when I'm going to a BBQ joint.

Everybody has their own view as to what BBQ should be, and in my opinion, Smoke offers a very tasty northern style BBQ. Good smokey flavor, nice rub, and a slightly sweet and tangy sauce. 

As part of my career, I have traveled all around America, and one of my hobbies is trying BBQ while traveling, so I consider myself an non official expert amateur BBQ sampler. Smoke BBQ ranks in my personal top 10. 

We live close to this restaurant, and have eaten there at least once a month for the last 2 years. Obviously I like the BBQ at this joint, but what makes a restaurant good is the consistency of the food,  of the service, value, and of the cleanliness. Smoke BBQ is consistently good in all of those categories. 

The menu features a variety of Smoked BBQ meats, ribs, riblets, brisket, etc. which are all smoked in house, by the owner, Jim. The menu also offers surprisingly good pizza, of which they usually offer a rotating gourmet style speciality. The crust tastes homemade and is crispy, and the toppings are fresh and generously applied. Another item that we have tried are are the burgers. Again, freshly made, nicely sized, and delicious. 

The side dishes are quite generously sized. (I know I keep using generously, but it's true! Try the house made chips, you get a small mountain of them. the french fries with rosemary are the same way!)
 
Another cool thing they do is offer Smoked hams and turkeys for the holidays. We got a smoked ham for Christmas, and it was incredible! They offer a different cut than you get at the grocery store, tender, delicious, and unique. 

Lastly, service has Been first rate on every visit, friendly and attentive. 

So to sum things up, Great Q, nice size portions, consistent food quality, and service. Nice variety of non Q offerings on the menu, and an overall good value. 

Food Giants rating system;  5* = Freakin' Great. 4* = Really Darn Good.  3* = sure, why not, 2*= it's better than starving, 1* = A hungry homeless person, after one bite,  wouldn't eat this, even if you gave it to them for free.

GbFiay7diwPiLMNdfNjWWg,hD2p1CFI7ZYjzjc2rVSRpA,_eVRTu6051uIYbr4n_y9zQ,2.0,8,0,5,"I went to their grand opening celebration on Sunday at 5pm with my mom. The place was packed. They were supposedly having a band play outside but because of rain, they were moved into a banquet room inside. Every table was filled with young families from outside of the retirement community. We were amazed at the number of people there. Obviously advertising in the local community made a difference. It seemed like this well known joint from East L.A. was not going to have any trouble getting business. 

At the restaurant, our group asked to be seated. We were told they weren't seating anyone, yet there were at least a hundred people already seated in the banquet room next door as well as at their restaurant and back room.  The waitress said we could come back in an hour at 6pm to get our name on a list to be seated at that time. It didn't make sense. Why were all of these outside families being seated, but our group from the retirement community being told to come back later?  We left and found another restaurant to eat at. 

A few days later on Wednesday, we came again at 5pm. We joined our group of friends that was already seated. The restaurant appeared to be either understaffed or not staffed with competent people. A ""flying club"" of about 30 people was meeting in the back room, and one waitress appeared to be dealing exclusively with them. The other waitress was handling all of the inside tables and outdoor patio tables. She was obviously overwhelmed. 

After waiting a period of time and no one giving us menus or drinks, my mom went to the bar to see if she could order from there. Tammy, the bartender was extremely busy. She was helping take drinks to the patio tables outside. One man from another group went to the bar to get his drinks and she yelled at him to not touch the drinks at the bar. Apparently he had been waiting for his drinks to arrive and thought he would just pick them up himself. After my mom witnessed that negative interaction, she decided to just grab menus and sit down. 

Our waitress finally made her way to our table to handout credit card transactions to others in our group who were leaving. She took our drink and food order at that time. We were told the restaurant was out of tacos and out of pork. They are known for their famous burritos with pork, but we were told they could serve them to is with shredded chicken instead. My mom opted for a taco salad with ground beef. I selected a bean and cheese burrito. 

.....crickets.....

The wait was painfully slow. No drinks arrived. My mom approached the bartender again. There were a lot of drinks waiting to be taken to people, but the waitress never did get them. The drinks had been sitting there for some time because the ice had melted in them. The bartender started bringing them to our table, but she wasn't sure whose drinks  they were. She put three watered down drinks in front of us. One was partially drank by someone and the other two may not have been margaritas. Hard to tell with the ice melted and orange wedges instead of lime at the rim of the glass. Obviously they were no longer margaritas ON THE ROCKS. She put another drink in front of my friend who said she didn't order the drink. The bartender then grabbed all of the watered down drinks and took them away. Fortunately, she made two fresh margaritas on the rocks for my mom and me, which was what we ordered and had been waiting for this entire time. They finally arrived at our table along with our food. 

The bus boy was nice enough to notice that we didn't have silverware or napkins. He brought us some right away so we could enjoy our food. The taco salad was really quite large with lots of goodies. There was a cup of jalape√±os on the side, and a cup of habanero sauce on the side of my mom's salad and lots of guacamole inside. My bean and cheese burrito also had a side of habanero sauce, but no guacamole or sour cream. It was quite large too and tasted fine. 

The food and drinks were really not worth the wait or expense (our two margaritas, taco salad and burrito were about $33). Applebee's serves better tasting margaritas and they come with chips and salsa which wasn't the case here. The service on both occasions that I came to El Tepeyac was not up to par. I understand that new businesses will take some time to iron out the wrinkles, but this restaurant already had a loyal following from its California location. They really needed to bring their experienced wait staff with them to make the opening days at this location more of a success. We wish them well and hope the next time we come that they have their full menu available and competent wait staff to deliver it in a timely manner.",2018-03-15 14:39:24,True,0.11310255630408998

Since I broke my ankle my dining mainly revolves around delivered takeout. And mostly Thai takeout at that. In the last month I've tried quite a few different Thai places - and this one is currently at the bottom of my list.

I ordered online, which provides you with the option to add in any requests and a handy estimate of when your food will arrive. I usually order through SkipTheDishes because I find their online ordering system better, and usually it's their drivers. This restaurant has it's own drivers, which means there's no GPS tracking. As requested, the driver phoned when he arrived at my apartment building (just after the latest estimated delivery time) and I went downstairs to meet him. When he was nowhere to be seen, I called him with no answer and had to stand out by the road on crutches. He picked up the phone after 5 minutes and he'd gone to the wrong address. I did get my food, but I had to wait outside for more than 10 minutes - normally not a big deal but my broken ankle wasn't happy about it, especially when I'd noted in my order that I'm on crutches.

I tried the shrimp salad rolls, chicken fried rice, a beef stirfry and the coconut rice with mango. Overall I found the food a bit average in taste - plus less veggies in the fried rice than the other Thai places and no mushrooms in my beef stirfry - but they left in the onion that I requested to have taken out. I also had a really sore stomach after eating the food. Plus the coconut rice with mango was just mango. The restaurant notes that fresh mango isn't always available, so I requested to only have the dessert if fresh mango is available. Looks like they decided this meant I only wanted half of the dessert without checking.

I contacted SkipTheDishes about the delivery and dessert issues, who in turn contacted the business. It took almost a week for them to get back to me while waiting to hear back from Delicious Thai and the restaurant refunded the dessert. 

Overall.. I found the service lacking and the food quality really wasn't worth it. Especially with so many other good Thai restaurants in Calgary.",2015-08-06 23:09:39,True,0.10996682062186816

Oh how many times we have passed by and I said to myself, ""Self, I wonder how this place is?"" Shrimp pad thai was ordered, 3 chiles! HOT! It took 5-10 minutes and brought it home piping hot. The portion size was just OK, perhaps below average. 4 shrimp included and yes, I always count how many I get to decide the quality of the dish for the price. This pad thai obviously had peanut butter in it which is A-OK as I like a little sweetness to the dish. The noodles were thicker than normal, like fettucine. Fresh lime and peanuts added and an oddly healthy portion size of finely juliened carrot. Too much of it that took the place of where more pad thai could have been. No leftovers as I normally have with this portion size and if I ever order again I will ease up on the chiles from here - I was up most of the night with heartburn! My bad!

We wanted to have a specific Thai dish and needed delivery and after looking this was what I found. When I called the man who answered barely spoke or understood English but apparently he's the only one who can take orders. It took five mins for him to get my address, phone number, name and credit card right.

On there menu it says that you can pick how spicy you want your dish. I asked the man to please make my orders mild (which everything was) and Colin's order extra spicy. I repeated extra spicy a number of times and asked specifically once if his would be extra spicy. He never at any point during my order said he could not do this. In fact he said ok. I also asked for our order without red and green bell peppers( which are sweet and not spicy in any way). I also read what the menu listed as ingredients and asked if anything else was in the dish. He told me no and i told him it was very important that it came the way it was in the menu with no extras and he promised it would. After repeating the order to him multiple times he still repeated it back wrong. Still we worked it out and got off the phone.

A short time later the food came. So I will say that the delivery time was reasonable.   The bill reflected a different price then the menu on their OWN website. We don't care that much about price but many will. Everything we ordered was at least a dollar more than on their menu. When you order a few items that can add up. Plus when the food is mediocre it's not worth the price. The food is made with cheap ingredients and popping with the cheap stuff while very sparce on the ingredients you expect to see for the price. The restaurant boasts authentic food while three out of four of the items we ordered were nothing like the authentic dishes.

We opened our dinner and it looked nothing like the authentic Thai dish I have made and we have ordered from other Thai restaurants. Plus it had cheap from frozen veggies filling the container, after we were promised no extra crap.  Colin's dinner was as mild as they come and not extra spicy.

I picked up the phone and called them right away. I told him our dinner had extra veggies and Colin's dinner was very mild. The man tells me first that we asked not to get red or green bell peppers so they added the veggies. I told him I specifically asked him not to and he agreed. He says it's the way that dish is made. I KNOW this is not true and tell him his dish is nothing like the authentic dish and plus the authentic dish does not have frozen veggies in it. Then I say plus Colin's dinner was very mild not spicy. He says that without the bell peppers it won't be spicy. To which obviously I remind him that bell peppers are sweet. Then he says that you cant get that dish in anything but mild and I am mistaken about the spice option printed in a huge square on their menu. I told him this was not good customer service and he had told me we could have extra spicy and that the dishes would not have extra ingredients. 

He responds with; and this deserves it's own paragraph because it's important that people read it; ""well then don't order food from us then"". I have worked in service jobs and I would NEVER tell a customer to shop somewhere else if they are being calm and have a valid complaint. In fact I wouldn't even say it if a person were rude. I was calm and polite in making my complaint and the man was rude and offered nothing but arguments and insults. 

In my reviews over the years you will see that even if a place was not so great, I want to go back and give it another chance and that I will still point out a positive. Delicious Thai is mediocre, over priced food with a rude and completely unprofessional staff. I will not be going back and I will be telling everyone I meet not to as well.

In the past, dining here was a bit slow especially at lunch but they ditched their lunch specials, which has sped things up considerably. The menu is extensive and a little bit hard to follow but once you figure out what you want, you're good to go.  We ordered the dinner for 6 for $120 which amounted to 2 appetizers of spring rolls and stuffed chicken wings, 4 entrees consisting of green curry, ginger beef, cashew chicken, vegetables with tofu and pad thai. The entrees were book-ended with generous portions of coconut rice and a dessert of sticky rice with mango.  

My dining partners have diverse tastes but each one was very impressed with the quality of food, flavours and presentations.  Usually someone is unhappy with something but I can honestly say that not a single person left feeling hungry of dissatisfied with the meal.  We packaged up what we didn't devour and brought it back to the office for later consumption.  The favourites were the Pad Thai, the Green Curry and the Stuffed Chicken Wings.  

It does have some detractors, the dining room is small and not the most up to date but at least they have tried to put in a effort and use what they have to the best of their ability which is endearing. The servers English wasn't the best but at least she tried to socialize with us which was really good considering apart from a take out order, we were the only diners in for lunch. 

This isn't a place you go to for the decor or ambiance, its strictly about the food and if you are fan of Thai and are looking for tremendous value, I'd highly recommend it.

I guess I should not really judge the food too harshly as a vegan as there were only a couple things I could eat.

Although, the plating was real pretty. 
Also, aesthetically it kind of made me depressed in here. Not the best of lighting, and the long white tablecloths were really gross.

The calamari was nice and crispy, not greasy, wide oval slices accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce.  The curry was a decent portion and could easily feed two persons and the coconut rice was so pungent we could smell it before it came to the table.  Even at a mild curry rating, it still had punch, but then again I love hot spicy food.

The environment itself has great potential for a vibrant, ever youthful experience, but the lack of enthusiasm from the servers turned what could have been a glowing treasure that has persevered to a worn down, weary from the test of time ice cream parlor.

I had the opportunity to work at Country Maid in the mid-1980s and was able to watch the ice cream making process, which is done in-house. It's all done with real milk, natural flavorings, and lots of care. And we were always big on cleanliness -- everything was scrubbed multiple times a day. You can enjoy your ice cream, sundae, or milkshake (made with the old fashioned way) inside or out on the deck.

They've expanded quite a bit since my time in the 80's, but the same family still owns and manages the business -- so the same care and attention to detail is there. Also here is fresh fruit (apples, blueberries, raspberries, plums, pears, and cherries) and vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, etc.) for sale at the building behind and to the left of the ice cream store. 

Working there, I got the chance to taste everything. There really isn't a bad flavor. My personal favorite flavors would be penuchi fudge (caramel), chocolate chip, or black walnut.

Born in France, she decided to follow the call of God when she was 20 and she dedicated her life to the poor, women and children.
After meeting Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, who was the governor of Montr√©al, she decided to migrate to Ville-Marie (that we now know as Montr√©al) in the Nouveau-Monde in 1653.
There she quickly became the angel of the infirms and the poor people and she had a crucial role in the education of many children.
She strongly believed that women were the key to the future of the country and worked very hard with Jeanne Mance, the administrator of the hospital, to make sure that all the women of various social classes in the colony could learn a job, preparing them for their new role of spouses and mothers and being a menthor and a trustworthy confidant and teacher for many children.
In 1655 she asked all the habitants of the colony to help her build a pilgrimage chapel, which was completed after 20 years in 1675.
Sainte Marguerite Bourgeoys was the founder of the Congr√©gation de Notre-Dame and until her death in 1700, she completely dedicated her life to the welfare of the people of Montr√©al.
She was canonized in 1982 and she now rests in the same place where she spent most of her life. This church is a beautiful tribute to her history and to the city of Montr√©al. 
 I felt moved and humbled at visiting such an important place, where many pilgrims from across the globe come every year to pay their respects and leave an ex-voto in the shape of a heart, symbolizing the generous heart of Sainte Marguerite Bourgeoys.",2016-10-20 04:47:18,False,0.06104035817854869

The guide will provide general background information on the chapel itself, its history, and many of the decorative touches that adorn the interior. Do you know why those hearts are hung on the wall near the altar? Why models of ships are hung throughout the nave? How the interior painting was thought to be lost? You will if you get that guide. It was also a welcome excuse to sit, out of the heat of the day, listen, and learn. 

I'm guessing that most tourists begin and end their church visits at the Notre Dame Basilica up the road - don't be that tourist. Head the few blocks north and enjoy.",2015-05-27 22:48:13,True,0.0762731618493981

Not a whole lot to see inside (though what is there is very detailed, elaborate, historic, baroque)... the main draw is going upstairs to the tower and see the views of the river and old Montreal.  The museum on the upper level is very very very boring, about the life of Marguerite Bourgeoys.  Not saying that her life was boring, but the way it's presented to you is not worth your time.

Anyway, take a gander at the chapel; skip the museum talk and dollhouses and such, and climb up all the crazy staircases to the top of the church.  The staircases going down are not the same (these staircases are too small to handle two-directions of traffic), and they lead to a sort of crypt-basement that was kinda neat, but nothing really special.

She's considered the 'mother of the colony', the colony being Ville-Marie, the future Montreal. Called to teach, she helped educate children and provide aid to the poor. On the site of the current chapel (from 1771) lies the remains of the original stone structure Marguerite would have known.

The actual chapel is far humbler than the grand basillicas found elsewhere in Montreal. Walking through the museum, however, you'll learn quite a bit about Marguerite Bourgeoys. In fact, one room is dedicated to explaining her life through...scenes in a dollhouse. These dolls were made by sisters in the late 20th century and can be considered Madame Alexander meets Madame Bourgeoys.

The best attraction by far in the museum is the staircase that leads to the top of the chapel. You'll have amazing views of Vieux Montreal from the top. There stairs are fairly steep so take your time.

The view alone adds an extra star to this review.

The church is...just a church with interesting stained glass windows, stone altar, and the regular assortment of religious art, but it does have some interesting features with replicas of sailing ships adorning the chapel (it seems the chapel is a favorite with sailors).  It's the views of Old Montreal and the Vieux-Port from the church tower make it worth the trek to this part of Old Montreal.  The small museum is located in the crypt of the church and has an adjacent associated archeological site that you can also tour.  The museum would be worth the admission to a someone interested in the history of a Canadian saint (and a woman to boot), but I can't comment on the archeological site since I didn't partake of it.

The chapel is thankfully free, but there is an $8 admission fee for the museum (it's steep considering all you get is the museum and tower access for the views).  You can add the archeological site for an extra $2, which might make it more interesting (I don't really know).

The job was quick and they even hauled away the debris. We ended up hiring an interior designer and as a result, hired Richard to do the projects. Richard's team installed new floors in the kitchen and bath, new countertops, backsplash, lights, etc. Fortunately, Richard's team suspected a leak when doing the floors and was able to repair. During that time, Las Vegas had experienced rain and a leak in the roof was also discovered and thanks to Richard it was repaired.

When we asked why the price was so high, we were told that we ""had no idea what other veterinarians were charging. Take the insulin or don't."" 

Once we were given a $400 estimate for a procedure that we felt was fair, and signed off on it. Upon picking up our dog, the bill was THREE HUNDRED dollars more than the estimate we were given. We asked why it was so much more than what we had previously been told, and the front desk secretaries were EXTREMELY rude saying that we had already signed off. They were unwilling to explain the difference in the quote/actual bill or budge on the price. 

Subsequently, soon after this incident, we received a letter saying that they would not provide care for our dog any longer. This was immediately following a serious illness, which required a veterinarian who knew our dog well for follow up care. It put us in a very difficult situation, left us without care for our beloved dog, and responsible for paying a $700 bill to which we did not sign off on, or know of prior to the treatment.

I feel that this should have been brought to attention all the way up the chain and I should have gotten a call from management or the partners to ensure this doesn't happen again.  Second, when I leave my pet for a procedure, does not matter what it is, I expected to see the vet when I pick up my pet for a briefing, not just the vet tech.

I'm a fan of Under Armour and have been for a long time, so it was music to my ears when I heard that another location would be built closer to my house.  Until last week, there was only one UA retail store in the Las Vegas area at the South Premium Outlets, but now its younger, bigger brother has arrived at the North Premium Outlets.  

I happened to go in on the day that the 40% off sale started just in time for Memorial Day weekend--woot!  This store is large and in charge, and as mentioned by Marie T. in her review, there is a dedicated Youth section that has much to offer the younger set.  I easily found some new shorts and also got my first pair of UA shoes (for the gym, not running), both of which were on sale.  There were lots of other things I wanted, but I already bought more than I planned since this was just supposed to be one of those, ""Let's see the new store!"" visits not a ""Let's spend money!"" outing.

The women's section also has an entire wall dedicated to sports bras. The quality of their materials are so soft and very comfortable when working out/sweating.

I showed him a photo of what i wanted (short almond nude with a chrome ombr√© tip), and he told me he can do it. When he shaved down my last fill i noticed he did not shave all of the glitter from my last set. When it came to shaping he wasn't slimming the nail which created an off oval shape. I reminded him again that I wanted a short almond nail, which made him become frustrated. He couldn't get the shape or length evenly and filed my skin once very harsh. I pointed out he did not fill my nails in all the way (the sides untouched), he began to have an attitude. I started to get uncomfortable the way he was acting inconsiderate. Finally we come down to painting... He told me, ""I don't have the color or chrome powder/polish."" Mind you before we started I asked him if he could do the exact look. I told him i felt disappointed with the way the nails look unfinished, and frustrated because I was mislead! He began to defend himself, ""I have been working for 25 years, and hard too. My work is perfect you're demanding TOO MUCH!"". The two coworkers I mentioned earlier looked disappointed as well. He was acting unprofessional and told me they all work very hard... I work hard too! I pay to get my nails done so they're sturdy and neat for work! The man doing my nails got offended I told him how unhappy I was. I realized he no longer wanted to communicate, but to argue disrespectfully. Since what i asked for could not be done at that location I told them ""I decided to go to my original salon to complete the rest of your work."" He began to call me a ""stupid girl"" and that i'm super ""picky"", when seriously all he did was fill my nails sloppy, and shaped my nails unevenly and filed my finger because he wasn't paying attention! What really had me unsatisfied as well is the fact he told me he was the MANAGER. The manager became very rude that I was ready to leave, ""I spent over an hour on your nails!"" as if his empty store was buzzing for his help and it originally takes nearly 2 hours to complete a FULL set!!! After explaining to him that it was unfair to pay him the full price of a manicure he was demanding I gave him $10 for the hour of his labor. Never EVER coming here again!

My sister goes to this place every once in a while for a polish change, so when I was thinking about getting a manicure for myself I decided to come here. I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat. 

I walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.

 An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off. 

Frustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were ""too busy"" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation. 
She apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left. 

The shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails).

As Madison experiences all four seasons, make sure you pick the season you like most when you visit. It can be bitterly cold in the dead of winter and blisteringly hot in mid Summer.

As downtown Madison is situated between two lakes, traffic flow is often your greatest challenge when navigating.  As of June 2018, there are quite a few construction projects creating additional traffic flow bottlenecks.

For my 1000th review it seems only fitting to f√™te the city that's earned its place as my hometown. Combined, I've lived in Madison longer than anywhere else. I came for college at the University of Wisconsin, and despite heading off for stints in Austin and San Francisco, I've ended up back in these seventy-seven square miles. 

I love that Madison has the feel of a small town but offers much more than you'd find in a small community. Walkable neighborhoods, endless parks, more restaurants than I could cover in a year, and I can get virtually anywhere in town in thirty minutes or less...as long as I don't take the Beltline at rush hour. 

Some of the city's greatest hits: the Memorial Union Terrace, Concerts on the Square, Live on King Street, Olbrich Gardens, the Dane County Farmers Market, curds on curds, Babcock ice cream, beer boots, supper clubs, the Wisconsin Badgers, sunsets over the lake, free museums, State Street, the UW, cherry bounce old fashioneds, and an airport that often takes fewer than fifteen minutes from parking garage to boarding gate. 

Thanks, Madison, for being the place where I met a lot of my life-long friends, the place that lured in my immediate family, and the place that led me to my dream job of being Community Manager for this great city.

But what none of you know is that before it was any of those things, it was the capital of Wisconsin. Originally called Whisk-on-sin because they whisk the dairy products that they make here, and because a river of sin flows through the state. Er.

Actually what flows here is a beautiful lake. It's massive, and is a huge part of the beauty of the downtown area. The capitol building is also absolutely gorgeous, much like your sister was last night ohhhhh.

Madison has changed a lot. It was always a cool college town, but now the whole downtown area has been turned into one massive hipster college area. It's probably one of the most hipster areas I've ever been to. The difference between here and somewhere like Williamsburg and Brooklyn is that a lot of the people wandering around and doing the Hipster things are not so hairy and not so averse to showering. 

In fact they are absolutely gorgeous. There are some very good looking people attending University here in Madison. And even though summer does not last very long, walking around the central area will leave you gawking at some of the extremely revealing outfits and amazing bodies of both boys and girls. For young people who like looking at other sexy people, Downtown Madison really is the heart of Wisconsin.

Other than all the amazing stores and cool restaurants, you also have the aforementioned spectacular beauty of a massive Lake right next to the downtown, and of the amazing impressive Capitol Building dominating the scenery for miles. Definitely one of the most naturally beautiful capitals of any state, and when you combine it with all the sexiness, this is easily a Five Star City to visit that I have underrated for too long. 

Greenland Tea House is the best (and only authentic) Bubble Tea in town. I haven't had an amazing meal here yet. The Ian's Pizza slices are just OK. Paul's Pelmeni is very interesting and delightfully affordable, but neither healthy nor out-of-this-world. Other stuff here was too disappointing to mention. Odd, considering Oshkosh, Green Bay, and especially Milwaukee (and Chicago, duh), have intergalactic foods that are all their own.

Despite the limited foods, the 5 star rating is all about how much I enjoy walking around Madison, the liberal atmosphere, the gorgeous scenery, and the beautiful young people.

Unfortunately I have yet to have a good concert here, but I did mean a lovely friend named Gwen when I played the concert here, and she is still my friend to this day even though she lives in New Jersey now. You can't have everything. Just kidding I love Jersey. Cough. Cough.

After chatting briefly with the store manager about pies in Calgary and elsewhere, I chose the raspberry/blueberry combo for take-out. Once home with my favorite coffee, heated up a piece, added some quality French vanilla ice-cream, and presto, good afternoon treats!

At first blush, the berries tasted fairly fresh and vibrant, and the flaky crust spoke of butter, and a certain baking finesse that sets good pies apart from poor to bad.

The downsides?
Underlying flavour.
After eating a second piece on the following day, it became apparent that the flavour is somehow dampened, and not nearly as good as they could be. Why does it seem so hard to make a truly outstanding fruit pie commercially? I don't know, but, as is exemplified at Simple Simon Pies, the tongue knows stuff that the bakers may miss or try to conceal. Trust it more. 

Price! 
Striking the balance between the three core elements - quality, quantity, price - for any product or service is dicey, but these pies are far too small for the price charged! 

On both of the above counts, in another city, many times we enjoyed delicious multi-berry pies that were twice the size and weight for almost half the price ($14): among these 3 factors, they had attained the balance wonderfully well, and their pies literally flew off the shelves. Often by mid-morning at both sites in the city, their daily run was sold out!
But at Pie Junkie? 
Ah, but $26 for a small pie both in diameter and filling just doesn't cut it! Nor do the flavours compete favorably with the other place. 
In my opinion, even in this trendy district with the high cost of rent, these little pies are still only worth $15 tops. Even at $18 they'd be stretching it, but $26? Little wonder I sensed a hiccup from the manager after we talked about the pies at the other place...

If these pies were twice the size and depth and pounded your taste buds with flavour and texture, I'd consider returning. But as it is, likely not. Too bad.",2018-04-24 23:23:17,True,0.15577724798832238

Atmosphere: pastry house with modern appeal. Place only has a small counter to dine in not meant for big crowds. Service was wonderful and extremely friendly. We could tell they were passionate about making their pies and that passion transferred to their products. Wouldn't be surprised if they are actually pie junkies for real.

Food: we ordered the Jamaican hand pie and the lamb pie. Both were bursting with flavor and crust was flaky but not overly buttery. Would love to try their dessert pies next time.

Given that, while visiting my sister, she insisted that I go to Morgan's, her magical shoe store. The husband and I browsed for a few minutes before someone offered to help us. He measured my feet, offered me water, and went to the back to get some shoes. So far, so good.

Now one of my issues with shoe shopping is that I can usually tell, within seconds of putting a shoe on, that it absolutely Will. Not. Work. I have bought many shoes in my life optimistically saying, ""They'll break in! It'll be fine!"" Spoiler alert -- they do not break in, and it is not fine. This generally leads me to rapid-fire try on every shoe available in my size in the store, in the hopes of finding something that fits.

In a setting like Morgan's, then, where they bring out a few pairs at a time, things get tedious and annoying very quickly for everyone involved. I promise I am not trying to be a pain...but I am NOT getting talked into a pair of expensive, unattractive shoes that aren't a PERFECT fit. And if I put a shoe on and it immediately hurts some part of my foot, I am done with those shoes. There is no point in spending 15 minutes playing with tiny adjustments; it is a lost cause and I abandon it.

So what happened at Morgan's is what always happens. I tried on a few pairs that were moderately attractive and not moderately-priced, refused to try on a few pairs that positively screamed ""Grandma orthopedic shoes,"" got talked into trying on a few pairs by my companions (that I knew wouldn't fit or I wouldn't like, and yup, they/I didn't), and ultimately didn't find anything remotely plausible. The salesman was pleasant and helpful, but he couldn't really do much with the available options.

That said, they had several styles of posture-correcting seats out in the open to try, and I did find a nice one for working at my desk. I was even able to use my 10% off coupon.

Overall, if you are somewhat sensitive to how your shoes look as well as how they feel, or if you find you run out of options quickly, Morgan's may not be the magical solution for you. Aside from continually cringing at style and price, I don't have any real problems with the experience, but I didn't find anything even remotely promising, so I wouldn't bother going back.",2018-08-24 22:33:34,True,0.11726591397106119

Then a salesperson approached--and asked me to move!
I got up and started to walk out. Then, she said if I wanted shoes I needed to take a ticket!

I found their inability to set expectation and make some contact unprofessional and was put very far off when I was asked to move rather than a smile and ""we'll be right with you after I help this customer"" or some such. Only when I left did a salesperson shout after me. 
I bought a pair of shoes there several months ago and it was equally curt but efficient at least.

So yesterday I drove to The Shoebox in Black Earth where I was greeting QUICKLY by a very friendly salesperson who then spent a great deal of time with me.

Morgan's carries many brands for a small store, such as Ecco, Dansko, Tsubo, Birkenstock, Merrell, Lowa, MBT, Teva, and even Vibram FiveFinger ""shoes"".  There's tons of other brands I'm missing, especially since I don't peruse the women's section.  Prices can range from $50 to ~$400.  Don't forget to check the sale racks!

They also have excellent service which is plentiful but not pushy.  The vibe I get is that they don't work on commission, and a friend who worked shoes for years felt the same way.  When you are thinking of making a purchase, it's apparent that they really know their stuff.  They take the time to make sure the shoe is the proper fit after first measuring your feet, and can also recommend a number of inserts and things as well.  In addition, they seem to have some specialists on staff (after checking their website, it's Pedorthists) that can help people with feet/back/etc. issues.

I've even come into this place when it was busy over the holidays looking only for some replacement laces, and when I tried to buy them the person at the register said ""no charge"".  I was nonplussed as that was so atypical for *anywhere*.  It's not often I enter a store,  acquire an item, and walk out without paying - that's usually called shoplifting...

I feel bad giving Morgan's 4 stars because they're expensive, as I don't know their margins.  I just wish more of the shoes were in my price range.  However, I can usually justify it when I eventually do make a purchase because their products are so durable and you know you're getting a good fit.

One helpful thing is that they have a card where for every $50 you spend you get a punch, and I think at something like $250 spent you get $50 off your next purchase?  I might have that wrong, so your mileage may vary.

So far I've bought my most expensive shoes ever there, in a pair of $250+ MBTs, and will come back for some Tsubos and Eccos.  If you're looking for a pair of shoes that will last and are willing to pay for it, you'll be fine here.

The pork shoulder was smokey, perfectly spiced and moist. Both the red and white slaw complimented the flavors and added the necessary textural contrast. With four sauces to choose from, it was a fun choose your own adventure. 

The hand battered onion rings were the best I've had in a while and the chicken tenders had great crunch while remaining moist and juicy. 

I wish we had the space to try the fried okra and the Mac and cheese because lots of other customers raves about them.

Johnny Roger's is one of a thousand places I've heard about here and there but just never got around to trying. Last week, when my day ended in the same shopping center as the BBQ joint around lunchtime, I had ran out of excuses!

I stopped in on one of the coldest January days in a while after a long morning and an empty stomach. The restaurant is small, and somewhat a tight fit with most of the tables going down a long, narrow hallway. Still, cozy and they weren't too busy so I decided to dine-in. The girl at the front immediately greeted me and told me about the daily special: Chicken Sandwich with Chipotle Ranch, Cheddar Jack, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion. Well that all sounds awesome, and I'm easy to please. They serve it with a side of Mac & Cheese. I found a table and waited on my food.

Everything arrived relatively quickly. Since I was starving all day I bypassed all pleasantries and devoured the damn thing! The chicken wasn't dry by any means, but definitely needed the ranch sauce to make up for a sandwich with white meat. It was very tasty with all the right proportions of fresh and crisp veggies. The tomato was especially juicy and full of flavor. I usually don't go for chicken at a BBQ restaurant but I was glad I gave this one a go, and incredibly inexpensive as well!

The Mac & Cheese was good. I didn't really pick out anything extremely special about their Mac, but at the same time it was better than what I can make at home so I'd definitely order again.

Considering the modest menu prices, and the fact that I don't live too awfully far from here, Johnny Rogers BBQ definitely has my attention. I'll be back to try the MEATS.",2019-01-25 00:14:37,False,0.11186198438960862

Too many restaurants try to have something for everyone and they need to stick to a simple menu and do the things they have well. Johnny Roger's does. The decor is a rustic look that is popular now and fits perfectly with the menu. There is seating outside also. Doggies are welcome outside I heard while I was there. You order at the counter. The people at the register were very nice and friendly. They even laughed at my silly joke. After ordering , I sat and looked around. I was fascinated by the chalk written menu.

I didn't think that was bad considering how busy they were. Another thing I watched while waiting was the guys cooking in what is a limited space. They looked like a well oiled machine.

The place was full, surprising for a lazy Sunday evening in North York, and there seemed to be a good mix of families, students, Asians and non-Asians alike. 

Whenever I try a new Viet place out, I normally order the pho special, and this time was no exception. I was really surprised at the broth - very light and clear - and there was a generous helping of perfectly cooked thin noodles. Also, unlike some other pho shops, you could tell there were different cuts of beef, from the brisket to the thinly cut rare beef. A little more tripe would be good, though I can understand, especially in this neighbourhood, that they pulled back on some more risqu√© (for the western palate) elements.

Also in our order was the rice special (R1) and the vermicelli special (V1). The rice special had two types of grilled meat (pork chop and chicken) which were flavoured well, and beef that was saut√©ed with onions. The beef and chicken were perfectly cooked and delicious, while the pork was a teeny bit dry. There was a perfect mound of rice, topped off with a fried egg - would have been better if the yolk more runny, but there was enough to mix in with the rice that I took (about 1/5th). The pickled veggies weren't pickled enough; I'm not sure if they weren't holding the vinegar because they were grated instead of thick julienne chopped, or if they just needed a longer soak.

The vermicelli dish came with an awesome spring roll, along with three meats, too: Viet sausage, pork, and shrimp. The shrimp - minced and formed into a ball and wrapped around a sugar cane stalk - was great, but the sugar cane was flavourless like it had been sitting in too much water... The pork was thinly sliced and was good, but the surprising thing was the Viet sausage. Unlike the normal small links normally served, they had formed the meat into rectangles so the pan-fried blocks resembled spam or luncheon meat.

Overall a pretty good place serving this part of the city. There is obvious care taken in presentation, and with a few tweaks, it'll be amazing from tip to tail.",2019-02-04 02:41:30,False,0.11717122692684873

Long version:
After a stressful day, I crave comfort food, and today it was pho. As this is relatively close to work, I decided to check it out. I was encouraged (because authentic pho restaurants tend not to want to accept CCs) but hesitant when I saw the cash or debit only sign. The servers inside kindly told me there was no minimum I had to spend to use my debit card, for which I was grateful. 

I was seated in a dining room with modern decor, kept incredibly clean, and given an easy to navigate menu with items described in English, Vietnamese, and Chinese. The servers were super sweet, even helping me when I struggled to connect to WiFi. The atmosphere, service, and cleanliness here are top notch.

However, I care more about the food. I ordered the regular sized Pho Dac Biet, which is $10. The size was smaller than usual for the price. I got a measly 2 slices of beef, 1 piece of tripe, 1 piece of tendon, and 2 tiny beef balls. The broth tasted like something out of a can, completely lacking in depth of flavor. It filled me up, but it was not pho-nomenal.

We ordered some spring rolls and basil chicken wings as appetizers.  For the mains, I got bun bo hue and the wife had pho tai Bo Vien.

Let me begin by saying that the spring rolls were alright.  It had a very ""homemade"" taste to it.  Viet people who grew up and had their mom's spring rolls as a kid will know what I mean which isn't a bad thing.  They were a bit on the soggy side but they jam packed the filling.  Next was the basil fried chicken.  This was a major fail! The chicken was super tasteless as if all they did was fried up some chicken and tossed in some fresh basil and called it basil fried chicken.  I had to dunk the wings in my fish sauce that came with the spring rolls to actually finish the wings.  Very disappointed.  If you really want to see how a pho place does chicken wings, check out Pho Hung's fried chicken!

Anyway, let's move on to our mains.  Nothing really outstanding here.  My broth in my bun bo hue tasted very diluted and my wife's pho bowl was SUPER oily.

My dad and I got seated right away and we ordered the Bun Bo Hue, crispy spring rolls and a bowl of house special Pho.

15 minutes passed and we first got our spring rolls. These were really delicious! Probably what I love most about this restaurant. They are extremely crispy, freshly made and it also comes with a large chunk of pickled carrot, which was also refreshing to cleanse our palate. 

Five minutes after we got our spring rolls, we got a large bowl of pho and a small bowl of pho. My dad and I were confused since we never ordered the large bowl of pho - we ordered the Bun Bo Hue. So we notified the waitress that there must have been a mix-up and she said she'll double check for us about our order.

About five minutes or so went by and the waitress never got back to us about the status of my dad's bowl. In fact, she was taking other people's orders and didn't look us in the eye as she walked by our table. It was only after another waitress came by, saw my dad not eating the pho and asked us what was wrong. When we told her that there was a mix-up, she looked surprised (which gave me the assumption that the previous waitress never told anyone about our mix-up) and immediately got our order in. So we had to wait another 15 minutes for my dad's food to finally come.

My dad's bowl finally came in and he wasn't very pleased with the order. There was quite a bit of soup in comparison to noodles, and there wasn't anything special about it, either. It tasted like overly citrus spicy soup. I thought the house special Pho tasted good, but I didn't think it was worth the $8.50 price tag. The portion is quite big and they provided a good amount of noodles and meat in my bowl, but I also specifically asked for extra green onions (which was not fulfilled, unfortunately).

As someone who works in customer service, I can empathize that sometimes things can easily slip out of your head as you get multiple requests from different customers all at once, especially if you're new to working in the service industry. However, it bothered me how we were simply ignored by the first waitress about our problem. We were never given any follow-up and after 5-10 minutes of waiting ""for our bowl to come"" it seemed like nothing was done about it. If the second waitress had not asked us about our problem, I don't think we would have gotten my dad's bowl. I would have appreciated a simple explanation from the waitress - it feels uneasy being left out in the dark and not knowing what is going on.

We were given a 10% discount for the mishap, which I noticed, but the lack of communication and the typical taste of the food made me feel unenthusiastic to give this restaurant a good tip after we left. I definitely would like to come back again and give it another shot, because I have a feeling it was a pure accident rather than this restaurant being bad overall.

Lastly the prices are super affordable to say the least. I think this place is new so I would highly recommend checking them out before the crowds roll in!",2017-11-26 02:42:16,False,0.224979512932992

I've lived in Las Vegas for 13 years and I discovered this place about 2 years ago when it was under different ownership. The majority of the original crew is still there, the quality of the service has always been great, but now it's even better. They upgraded their system so you actually receive a text message to confirm and remind you of your appointment, I hear the website will allow you to book appointments online soon. 

At first I though it was a little out of my budget, but then I realized how perfect every cut is and how great it is to be treated like they appreciate the business. The hot towel treatment is great and the neck massage is a real treat after a long day in front of a computer screen.  

I have a personal favorite employee that I won't mention by name (because I'm selfish and I don't want her to get too popular), but I know from experience it doesn't matter who cuts your hair, the quality of the cut and the service is excellent. 

Did I mention they offer a hot towel and a shave for a few bucks extra? 

Try it out sometime. You won't be disappointed.

I pulled up and it was an old school speaker, when greeted it pretty much squawked at me but was still understandable. It took me a couple mintues to spit out the veggies I wanted on my tuna, for some reason I kept wanting to say green broccoli! The lady was very nice and kept reasuring me she knew what I meant. I had a coupon for buy one 6"", get second free so I got a spicy italian for my lunch today. She explained that the coupon required a drink. I hestitated and said sprite, because I really didn't want the soda, but she said I can substitute the bottle instead. Sweet! I can give that away easier.

When completing the transaction, the same lady greeted me warmly, asking how I was -exhausted- sympthizing with me and telling me as I left to get some rest. Very pleasant customer service.

The tuna was super good, but that could've been my hunger making the opinion. I would have perferred more tuna and less bread though. Spinach, green peppers and red onions tasted fresh and delicious!",2013-10-17 13:13:51,False,0.09931406262861911
