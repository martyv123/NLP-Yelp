The owner, Barret, has apparently been in the restaurant business since he was sixteen. Starting as a bus boy and made it to General Manager by twenty four. He's helped open several other restaurants in his time and with all that experience has decided to finally make one of his own so he can work closer to his family. 

Walking in the front door you are immediately hit with a wonderful smell. The menu is visible right away, half being above the counter and half on the wall to the left. One of my very few complaints is the small size of the restaurant, however I'm told even though they have only been open three weeks they are already in the process of acquiring the vacant location next door and expanding. I guess business has been good!

And I'm definitely not experienced in the world of brewing. While this is only my first brewing goods store, I seriously dig it. Can I thank the gods of the 21st Amendment to the US Constitution that ultimately led to a time in space where we can experiment with chemistry and brew our own beer?

If you want to start brewing and have never done it before, you don't need to look any farther than here. They have starter kits with everything you could need for both small (1 gal) and large (5 gal) batch home brewing. There's a bucket, gallon jug, air lock, thermometer, hydrometer (both glass), bottle capper and sanitizing solutions. I'm probably missing something too. All you need to buy in addition would be the pot for boiling and some caps. Drink yourself a few beers and save the bottles for when you've made your own. Last but not least, you'll need a kit.

Here they prepackage several kits for different beer styles and get it all ready for you to simply grab and go. There are 1 gal and 5 gal batch options. I've bought the Irish Red (a good first-timer beer), Hefeweizen and Oktoberfest. There are at least 5 other types that I've seen. If you're more experienced or a bit of a traditionalist, you can even build your own recipe from scratch or online guides. They have buckets of bulk dry grains and malt you can scoop to your delight. If you're in need of supplies to increase your output, cooling time, measurements, for kegging, they've got just about everything here. Including, to my surprise, things for brewing wine and even sake.

The prices aren't bad, I guess. But again, I've got little to no experience and I've also heard this is the only shop in Charlotte selling this stuff so they may be able to get away with charging a premium.

My only rave review was for the stylist that fixed my hair after Ashley's two botched dye jobs. I had been in tear due to the horrific look i was given. I was getting ready to meet with the governor and needed my hair to not look like a freak show before i met with him. I was promised the own would get my hair back to the original blonde color that Ashley spent the whole time bashing telling me blonde was so out of style and looked bad. Look at the pictures, you tell me if that looks blond or baliage?

Quite possibly one of the worst long experiences of my life went in for Baliage tohelp even out an all over color ended up leaving looking like a striped skunk with red and black stripes in my hair which were not the colors that I asked for my hair was cut very unevenly unprofessionally I later found out that the Stylist with was an apprentice an had no experience in Baliage. had I known I would never have let her touch my hair. She had the front desk girl mixing dyes for her which I'm certain she was not trained to do so. I came back for a second time and the stylist promised she could fix my hair and again my hair looks worse it was actually darker and none of the lighter blonde which I wanted and ended up close to being a brown color I finally complained and asked for another stylist the other stylist was able to get my hair to the point where it was presentable enough to go in public again but was not able to return me to my original blonde because of all the black and red that the first Stylist put my hair I was told I would need to come back another time to get my hair back to blonde. I finally asked to have the owner fix my hair and made an appointment when I came in to see the owner to get my hair back to the original blonde from the brown and weird colors that were in it she told me that she was going to charge me to fix their mistakes so now I have hair that is not the color that I wanted when I came in, it's damaged from the over processing, and uneven haircut.

Had to wait for drink refills in fact had a different waitress asked if I would like a refill as she noticed the empty glasse sitting on the table. After I was done asked for the bill and had to wait for that.. I think I agree with a few of the other reviews that the wait times are a little bit long and the staff is a little bit slow and what they do.

The best part of these stores is the support of local farms. This is how the better business bureau should spend their time...focusing on small businesses like these!
The American Dream is the idea of freedom that includes opportunity and success. It's about the hard working society of American people, coming together in economic prosperity (Thanks in part to a summarization of Wikipedia). I feel like families have a real opportunity to bond when they visit places like Country Maid. It brings that homey feel back to life. The old country store that Cracker Barrel took to a whole new level of franchise. Country Maid takes it down several notches to bring locals together. You can share some delicious sundaes with your family, friends, teammates, roommates, etc. Especially around summer time, it's a perfect place to stop. 
I enjoyed a large sundae with three different ice cream flavors. Cookies and Cream (with a chocolate ice cream base), traditional chocolate and penuchi fudge. Be sure to ask about penuchi fudge and you really have to try it to understand it's unique flavor. The gentleman that helped me described it as a caramel/maple flavored chocolate ice cream. He hit that on the nose, I think. However, I heard his colleagues describe it differently and other guests agree to those points. So, I suggest you see for yourself.

None the less, this is one of the best Kelsey's I've ever been to, as I've had horrible experiences with other Kelsey's locations.  I've come here numerous times and most recently I came here to watch the Raptors Home Opener.  I started with their drink special of the day, which was their Beer-ita, which is a ""the best of both worlds"", blended Tequila margarita topped with an upside down icy cold Corona.  Always good to have daily drink specials at a restaurant.  We ordered our traditional Spinach Dip (which might I add, that I am addicted to!) and I like to be a bit different and order my pita chips half baked and half deep fried, just to give it some variety.  Obviously, the deep fried tastes better but when you eat baked pita chips you feel healthier.. Definitely recommend this appetizer.  We also ordered the Calamari which usually comes with a seafood sauce but we also asked for Sweet Chili Thai sauce on the side.  Their Calamari is mediocre to me, nothing special.  To name a couple of other dishes I've had here, we've had the Buffalo Chicken Potato Skins (which I thought were pretty good, the boyfriend wasn't that much of a fan), Wonton Nachos (which aren't as good as their original tortilla chips), their wings (which I definitely recommend with whatever sauce you desire), Messy Fish Sandwich (one of my favourites and always a go-to), the ""HOLY BLANK"" 7 Layer Burger (which the boyfriend demolished and loved), Sizzling Fatijas (good to share and smells and tastes oh-so-delicious!), and Brew- Battered Fish and Chips (nothing special).

The interior was beautiful and the servers were polite but the food has a really long way to go.

Firstly the menu needs a lot of work. My vision is pretty good but there is no way I can see what each of the pictures had. I ordered a cold udon that appeared creamy orange in the picture but something different came out. The cold udon was neither cold or warm..... Kinda like room temperature and stale. Ingredients and flavour was plain but the side of wasabi was an interesting touch but my partner wasn't a fan of wasabi unfortunately. I strongly believe the average individual can make a more exciting dish at home with frozen udon, some beef at Galleria and vegetables. The quantity they served was hilarious when they serve small portions in a massive bowl. 

The sukiyaki tasted bland since the meat was over cooked and it was stuffed with very boring ingredients (think overcooked tofu and bean sprouts). Theres a pretty thick film of oil on the surface after the meal too. This dish was a fail for something in this neighborhood.

We started with the sardine appetizer: 2 whole Portuguese sardines on top of lovely grilled toast (crouton or crostini) with lemon, garlic and Portuguese olive oil.  Very yummy and different than you'd get from Italian sardines.  
For main course, my wife had half a roasted chicken (smaller than typical chicken, but still too big for my wife especially after the sardine) with a fabulous sauce (piri piri?).  It was served with a fresh, lovely salad made with what was called frissee, but was like the best leaf lettuce, olives, pickled red onions, and fried capers (my wife hates capers but loved these).  Additionally, there were transcendent, well-browned french fries with a lovely house made mayonnaise.  We were offered a spicier piri piri (?) sauce which was yummy.
I had the lamb chops on vegetables.  I'm not always a big fan of veggies, but loved these even more than the excellently cooked and spiced lamb. There was bitter notes from broccoli rabe, swish notes from carrots or some other root vegetables, petite white potatoes, and green beans sauteed to perfection and well browned.
We took home home pastelles natas for dessert: little custard filled pastries.  I was going to give the place 5 stars even if these were not good, but they were great.

The interior of the restaurant hasn't changed since the the first time I visited in the 90's (then a pizza place by the name of Mr. P's), so that was a bit of nostalgia I enjoyed.  And that was where the fun ended.

I ordered The Roast Beast, which is essentially a French Dip, and macaroni and cheese with bacon for an additional upgrade.  The sandwich was presented on a sesame seed hamburger bun, which was unimpressive, but the absolute lack of taste was the deal breaker.  It had none.  The meat was bland, there was hardly any (shredded) cheese on the sandwich, and the au jus tasted like it was made by boiling ten gallons of water and adding in one beef bullion cube.  The macaroni and cheese was orange, and clearly not made from real cheese.  It looked a bit like Kraft mac and cheese, but had even LESS taste.  I would have been more satisfied with Kraft.  

Worst restaurant food ever, and I'm no food snob.  I prefer literally everything I've ever had in any kind of restaurant establishment, even fast food, over this place.  If you're stuck in that particular area, the food at the convenience store/gas station right next door (RediGo) is better.  By a lot.

I decided  to return to Sapore where I previously enjoyed the wood oven pizza, which was actually quite good.  Though for New Years Eve they had a reduced menu and the pizza oven was not an option for anyone.  The dinner was at 5:30 and the restaurant was less then half full.  

We had a table of 4 and we all ordered appetizers, rib eye steaks at $36.00 each and a bottle of wine. The steaks were all cooked incorrectly, especially my steak that was grilled beautifully on one side, though heavily burnt on the bottom side.  While, other steaks were raw and almost cold to touch in the middle.  The vegetables were very poorly chosen as grilled leaks and beets did not compliment the dish that had a sweet blueberry steak sauce.   Very disappointing, if it wasn't a busy new years eve night, I would have certainly returned the dish.  

As for the appetizers (salads and calamari) and entrees the portions were disappointingly small for the price.  The prices are not justifiable.  The quality and quantity are severely lacking.  

Often good service can compensate, though our server ""Shirley"" was lacking professionalism.  She did not give proper attention and likely did not submit our order properly as we waiting an excessive amount of time for our food considering the amount of people in the venue.  She was unpersonable and unsympathetic.  Even with only 4 guests she automatically included 15% tip on the bill, she probably had a good sense she wasn't probably deserving to get that if she wouldn't have done that.

We did have to wait about 10 minutes or so in the chair as it was a bit busy but we were not in a rush so it was ok.

Staff was VERY attentive and friendly- it did not matter who you spoke to. The lady who did my pedicure did a fantastic job. She was very chatty and made my experience memorable. She also did the hot stone treatment which I found was a unique incentive with the pedicure. She really did a good job from start to finish.

The place is clean and well kept. I liked that they used the plastic wrap around the pedicure bowls. If I lived in Montreal- they would probably be my go to.

They were just a few steps from our hotel too which made it a lot more convenient for us. We didn't check out any reviews before we went in, we kind of just went with our gut because we just wanted a nice pedicure that was long overdue.",207,4/17/2018 13:08,TRUE,0.075003422

Sorry, but I just can't get over the fact that they don't clean this place. It looked like it could be doing way better if they practiced cleanliness.

The update left the hotel entrance with a bright, airy feel to it.  Unfortunately, it doesn't appear that the rooms have been similarly updated.  While not terrible, they could use a facelift, as well.

However, what makes this Courtyard is its front desk staff.  As several other reviewers have commented, they really are awesome!  One young lady, in particular, is exceptional.  No matter how long it's been between my stays (sometimes at least a year has passed) she ALWAYS remembers me and greets me warmly.  Of course, as I'm typing my review I realize I don't even know her name to give her proper credit.  D'oh!  Anyway, it's touches like these that really make me feel like a valued guest.  It is appreciated and results in an extra star for an otherwise 3 star hotel.",205,6/20/2013 20:56,TRUE,0.080729212

It's similar to a cooking show where you follow along with a live chef. Our latest chef, Kait, did an excellent job of leading our class of 11 people.

Chef Kait gave us valuable tips and gracious assistance when needed. A+++

The chef attendees kept our stations cleaned up, brought us ingredients and offered up water, coffee, cheese and crackers. A+++

What a delicious way to spend two hours! Be sure to sign up for Sur La Table cooking class emails. At least every other month you'll hear about special discounts on classes.

We were trying to decide if we wanted to take advantage of the buy one get one half of apps during happy hour with one drink purchase. So we decided to get a Gar Par fries and calamari for apps. The gar par fries were a bit small with very little sauce. The fries were crispy but taste weird inside, not fully cooked?!? The calamari appeared big but then I realized they cut the calamari very small and cooked them with lots of batter to look bigger. 

We also ordered three pounds of wings with the gar par and spicy flavour, honey garlic as gar par and dry Cajun. The only one that seemed good was the Cajun which had lots of spice and flavour. The spicy gar par didn't have enough gar par and lots of spicy. The honey garlic gar par was just a weird combo and didn't compliment each other. Perhaps more gar par flavour would have helped cause all I tasted was the honey garlic and not enough saltiness.

My work is perfect you're demanding TOO MUCH!"". The two coworkers I mentioned earlier looked disappointed as well. He was acting unprofessional and told me they all work very hard... I work hard too! I pay to get my nails done so they're sturdy and neat for work! The man doing my nails got offended I told him how unhappy I was. I realized he no longer wanted to communicate, but to argue disrespectfully.

The daily specials aren't really a deal at all and they still cost you $10. Also, the place isn't really in the best ""repair"" greasy looking floors and you'll often find the guy behind the counter just sitting on his phone or one time sleeping in the booth. 

The food itself is okay, but they don't give you nearly enough meat, and like most Subway Franchise owners are misers when it comes to toppings and extra stuff, literally counting the amount of diced tomatoes or pickles or radishes they include. That's a terrible attitude for ingredients and it reflects poorly on the restaurant. It also gives me the impression that despite the low amount of traffic, they don't care about giving the customer a good experience.

The tongs they use might as well be tweezers. Oh and I asked for some tzizki sauce and he told me he had to charge me an extra $0.75 for a spoon of it. Pathetic. 

Would I come back? Maybe. If they dropped prices in half.

We are from downtown Toronto and there are very few good (actually none) dedicated fish and chips stores.  This place was located in what appeared to be a derelict strip plaza and we were hesitant to enter, but we were pleasantly surprised.  There was a huge line up given that it was St. Patty's Day and also a Friday.  We instantly knew that we were onto something!

We entered the small dining room with one table taken with 4 elderly women.  We knew this place had to be good with the line up and the women at the table.  We both ordered halibut and chips from what appeared to be a very pleasant female Asian owner.  It is definitely a family owned business as you can see the children and the husband all in the open kitchen. 

Very quickly our steaming fresh fried F&C's appeared!  AYCE tartar sauce mimicked in the mustard bottle.  

Delicious home made (we think) cut fries and just melt-in-your-mouth batter for the halibut.

The folks behind the counter were quite friendly as I ordered and babbled about everything and nothing happy to have someone other than kids to talk to.

Johnny Roger's is one of a thousand places I've heard about here and there but just never got around to trying. Last week, when my day ended in the same shopping center as the BBQ joint around lunchtime, I had ran out of excuses!

I stopped in on one of the coldest January days in a while after a long morning and an empty stomach. The restaurant is small, and somewhat a tight fit with most of the tables going down a long, narrow hallway. Still, cozy and they weren't too busy so I decided to dine-in. The girl at the front immediately greeted me and told me about the daily special: Chicken Sandwich with Chipotle Ranch, Cheddar Jack, Lettuce, Tomato, Onion. Well that all sounds awesome, and I'm easy to please. They serve it with a side of Mac & Cheese. I found a table and waited on my food.

Everything arrived relatively quickly. Since I was starving all day I bypassed all pleasantries and devoured the damn thing! The chicken wasn't dry by any means, but definitely needed the ranch sauce to make up for a sandwich with white meat. It was very tasty with all the right proportions of fresh and crisp veggies. The tomato was especially juicy and full of flavor. I usually don't go for chicken at a BBQ restaurant but I was glad I gave this one a go, and incredibly inexpensive as well!

The Mac & Cheese was good. I didn't really pick out anything extremely special about their Mac, but at the same time it was better than what I can make at home so I'd definitely order again.

Considering the modest menu prices, and the fact that I don't live too awfully far from here, Johnny Rogers BBQ definitely has my attention. I'll be back to try the MEATS.",324,1/25/2019 0:14,FALSE,0.111861984

Yes, it's not as amazing as the Holt on Bloor but it's still Holts and that pink bag is as addictive as crack. I came here to get a birthday present and lo and behold, since I was actually BUYING something I received a lot of good customer service but maybe because it was that I was dressed in expensive clothes.
One time, I came in wearing jeans and runners, and received nothing but scathing looks from these sales associates. I was browing cashmere scarves and eau de toilettes. I had done my homework though and read reviews on the best ones and while I tried some scents that had been a big disaster for 2010, the knowledgable sales staff allowed me to try a new scent that was perfect, and had high reviews it wasn't too overpoweringly earthy\woody or aquatic either. 

After my card was declined, they were still kind and even kept up conversation until I called my bank and sorted everything out. Meanwhile, a second sales lady had wrapped everything up impeccably and added some extra samplers, smiling and talking about dinner and things of the sort. She was Italian and very kind, and the cashier was also very nice. The kind gentleman in the Armani winter section was so nice and helpful, completely unpretentious and understood I wasn't about to buy a $325 scarf. 

Other times I've come in looking for a handbag, the sales staff were snooty and I felt a bit intimidated but come in with confidence, believe you deserve the best and enjoy the experience--even if you don't buy anything. It's worth a visit while at Yorkdale and definitely rackets up the value of the mall. 

PS. The perfumes at Holt are a couple bucks cheaper than at Sephora--perhaps because Sephora gives out samples? Not sure if Holts does, but every time I ask they say (I roll my eyes here) they're out. 

I give this 3 stars because a) It's a Canadian store with some extremely drool-worthy brands and items 

b) It's very convenient and I still get butterflies when I go inside.

c) I actually received amazing customer service on my first Holt purchasing experience, leaving me feeling a bit more sophisticated on my way out. :)",385,10/23/2010 19:47,FALSE,0.143295967

She showed me an alternative to the GST  (Grande Shopping Tote) also - which I found very helpful as it was similar to the GST but didn't have the zip in the middle (which I was looking for).

Find an ENT office that will explain what ""procedure"" you are going through before they do it to you.   Office staff is rude. The wait in the office was long and the phone call hold time is usually more than 16 minutes (average of my 4 cell phone calls). 

I was referred to an ENT for possible sinus thickening that was found as a result of an MRI for migraines.  I randomly chose Dr. Taffet due to his proximity to my office and his practice being in my insurance's preferred network.  After waiting 45 minutes past my appointment time, I was ushered into a room and the Medical Assistant sprayed each nostril with a spray, seemingly no different than I had used for sinus problems in the past.  She informed me the spray would numb my sinuses, so that the doctor would look in my nose. Shortly thereafter the doctor came in and listened to my five-minute verbal history of my sinus and headache issues and to find out why I was referred to an ENT.   He then took a long scope and looked into each nostril for literally one to two seconds per nostril. This procedure seemed no different than going to every other doctor's appointment where they use a light to evaluate eyes, ears, and nose, but this was with a longer ""scope"" for the nose than I was familiar with.  After this quick ""scope"" Dr. Taffet and asked me to have a CT since he could not fully assess my sinus issues without a CT.  When I asked why the MRI I had already received was not adequate, the Doctor said not good enough because it did not show the tissue he needed to assess.

I went for a CT for my sinuses and willingly paid the $75 co-pay.   I picked up my scans a few days later to return for my appointment where the doctor could tell me what was needed because I essentially learned nothing from my initial visit.    This appointment was later cancelled for the following reason:

Before my next appointment with Dr. Taffet, I was billed for a ""surgery"" at his office.  I thought there was a billing mistake, so I called the office to find out what occurred.  The medical billing office informed me that the ""nasal endoscope"" during my initial office consultation was a SURGICAL DEVICE, and therefore I was billed for a surgical procedure.  I informed her that I was not informed of a surgical procedure upon my initial consultation.  She told me that 9 out of 10 people that walk in the door are scoped.  I asked her if they were ever informed this would happen on their first visit.  She said, ""No, but they are all billed as surgery.""  I was stunned that other people were not shocked with this change and calling to question the billing office.  She tried to explain, ""Surgery can be charged when any device enters your body cavity, such as your nose.""  As a non-medical-biller myself, the logic seems flawed because my doctors have never charged me for surgery to look in my ears, nose, or throat.   Nor has any gynecologist charged me a surgical co-pay for a PAP smear, which is far more invasive.   Based on this logic, most doctor visits would be able to charge you for surgery.  My surgery co-pay is $150.  I was with the doctor for approximately six minutes and was NEVER TOLD I was to undergo a surgical procedure.  Having been properly informed, I would have declined this ""surgery,"" ESPECIALLY before having had my CTs evaluated.   Since the billing was not erroneous, I filed a complaint with my insurance.  They investigated it through their management and I can do nothing else through them.  After speaking to Dr. Taffet's office manager, Judy, she was unwavering and has been unwilling to change their policy (or my billing) of informing vast majority that their first visit will be a surgical co-pay ($150) instead of a specialist ($35) co-pay.

The next day I called again just trying to confirm my appointment and I spoke to someone who told me that I would not be able to come that day. They were very nice in rescheduling me but this kinda defeats the purpose of online booking. My new appointment was scheduled for 4pm and I arrived at about 3:58pm. I was checked in and told that she would be with me in a minute. By 4:15pm, I was still waiting. At 4:25pm I asked if everything was ok. When I was finally taken into the back, it was 4:45pm. Hanin was very apologetic about the wait and ended up doing my underarm wax at no charge which was nice. I just wasn't sure why I was waiting for so long. I also noticed that both my Brazilian and my underarm was didn't last as long as other places I've gone to. The salon is cute and very clean and the prices are the same as other places I've been to. The salon also offers threading and micro blading and they do an excellent job on both.",263,4/8/2018 11:20,FALSE,0.133948257

The service is really what brings the rating down.  They gave away my suite even though I pre-checked in and they said it would be ready soon.

However, they did a poor job at rectifying the mistake.

The front desk had horrible communication problems.  Even the one nice girl who tried to be helpful didn't seem properly trained and kept throwing her co-workers under the bus for the mistake instead of taking responsibility (poor team work, come on people) and just making it right.

In the end (after WAY too much negotiating on my part) they gave me a different room, which I had to pay over $100 extra per night (which they tried to tell me is the best discount their manager will allow). I said I should at least get free breakfast for this crap and they FINALLY decided they could let me have 1/2 off (gee thanks).

As far as food chains in Canada go, Kelsey's is like the Coffee Time of the coffee chain world. They have a variety of items but the quality is meh...

The layout is nice and they have a big bar area with large TVs.  The service is pretty friendly but I think that's pretty standard and part of the standard corporate manual for all of the food chains.

There are plenty of food items to choose from.  Probably about the same amount as a place like Jack Astors but a few less than Pickle Barrel or Boston Pizza.  If you're really hungry, this place probably gives you most food on your plate. In fact, if you're more than one and neither of you are very hungry, you might be able to get by with one appetizer and one main.

Sadly, the reason why this food chain is at or near the bottom of the food chain is that it is afraid to use seasoning. I've never had so many items taste like water.  The potato skins were bland, the batter on the chicken fingers had no flavour and even the vinaigrette salad dressing had no acidity. 

I'm not sure if their chefs are worried about customers complaining that their food is too spicy or if they are trying to cut costs but if there's no taste in the food and you're going to give big portions, you're going to end up with alot of waste.  I think the best thing a customer can do with their unfinished food is take it home and repurpose it into their own meal and use their own seasoning to make it better.

The number of times I've visited, the staff is SO THRILLED [she said with extreme sarcasm] to be working and serving their community. Being someone who has always enjoyed the food service and hospitality industry, I quite despise the lack of interest. 
I am well aware that the food service industry can be and is, very difficult. Depending on the restaurant, there are long hours, tough crowds, hard labor, regular turn over, and the list goes on. However, everyone has a choice on whether to accept a position in the industry or not. So, when my family and I visit on a VERY slow, Monday night, at least greet us with a genuine smile. Also, please remember that beverages in plastic cups with lids generally require straws. While I appreciate the table-side service; though it's expected when there is a table number provided, please do not show frustration when we did not grab straws from the counter on the way to picking our table. Especially, when my brother moved to collect the straws on his own instead of asking. Small things to fuss about but the hospitality industry requires a bit of genuine kindness and I did not feel that from many of the staff at this location. 
To top it off, our food was delivered in what we considered a timely manner, however, my wrap was more of a bundled fold. They use an extra large wheat wrap and leave plenty of room for the proper wrapping technique; however, I was just short of unbundling and re-wrapping it myself. Just to reiterate, if you have no interest in working in the hospitality industry, that's okay, it's not for everyone. 
I am not commonly one to express such distaste which is why I still provided this location, 3-stars, but I want to be sure that my point gets across. When you have a PRIME location that is within walking distance for SO many in our ever growing community, take pride in it. Make sure that the people supporting the business are showing the customers their best side. Everyone has an off day and this is a quick meal style place but that doesn't mean it should lack in quality of service.

We showed up around 6:00 on a recent weekday armed with a reservation, and were quickly shown to a cozy table near the back. (It might've been a little too cozy, as we were seated mere inches away from other diners.)

I quickly settled on the Crispy Chicken Sandwich (""brioche sesame seed bun, southern fried chicken breast, kale & swiss chard slaw, tomato, baby swiss cheese, mayonnaise"") as my entree, and I asked for onion rings as my side.

It was apparent right from the first bite that I was in trouble. The most obvious problem here is the sogginess of the sandwich, which, given the word ""crispy"" in the name of the concoction, was especially off-putting. There was absolutely no crunch to be had here, and that was what I was in the mood for (and wouldn't you be if you'd ordered a ""southern fried"" chicken sandwich?)

The rest of the 'wich didn't fare much better, as all the components were either offensively bland or way too soft. The lack of texture was pretty much disastrous, and I ultimately found that the sandwich reminded me a *lot* of the chicken burger at Burger King.

The onion rings fared even worse, if that's possible. They, too, were super soggy and without any deep-fried deliciousness, and the breading was tasteless and underwhelming. Also, the rings came with ketchup, which is just such an amateur mistake I don't even have the worse.

Having said all that, the service was extremely friendly and efficient, so I might return to sample some of the joint's cocktails. Doubt I'll ever order food again, though.",298,6/5/2019 10:52,FALSE,0.088318943

This store is located in a newer plaza of stores, which features a Longo's and a Starbucks. I parked in short-term parking, steps away from the store, as I knew that I wanted a small ice cream sample before lunch. Yes, I had dessert well before a late lunch.

I walked in and was greeted with a ton of chocolate bars, fondue flavours in cans, and gift ideas. I looked at everything with curiosity and delight. Oddly, it felt like home to me, especially when I looked at the chocolate-covered nuts.

I looked at the various options on the menu when a helpful woman walked me through how to order. I am such a novice. This year has been resurrecting my ice cream sweet tooth and it caused me to get my conehead badge on Yelp!

You can order either a cone or a cup in four different sizes. I went with the mini, which is the second-smallest size. Ice cream flavours come in vanilla, chocolate, orange, raspberry, and swirl combos. You can also do sorbet. You can get either dipped in whatever flavour you want. You and your server simply walk over to the dipping area and choose.

I went with the raspberry-vanilla swirl. The raspberry is closer to a sorbet, but I loved the sweet-tart combination, especially paired with the vanilla. My order was roughly $6. It's not cheap, but if you come here periodically, it's all good.

We walked over to the dip flavours. I looked at this blue milk chocolate dip. It was cotton candy. You can sample these dips for free. I sampled this mysterious blue dip. You know what? It tastes EXACTLY like cotton candy at an amusement park. Sold!

You can do either the regular dip or go crazy with kooky, which has cookie bits and probably more sugar. I was fine with the regular dip. You can also get sprinkles on top. I decided not to do it, as the dip had enough sugar for my liking.

You can pay by cash, and debit and credit cards. I paid with a credit card. All went smoothly.

I grabbed a plastic spoon and napkins, thanked this woman, and left.

I bit off the top part of the dip, and got into the raspberry-vanilla ice cream. They worked so well together. Yum!

The dip is pretty thick. I had difficulty biting through it as I worked through my cup. At one stage, I essentially put my entire face into the cup to try and bite through it. I recall seeing plastic knives at the store. I now know why you need one. Considering how thick the dip is, with my luck, I would likely break the knife. Perhaps I should carry a pocket knife before I head over to this place.

I then had another thought. How do you eat the cone version with dip? I would have blue cotton candy dip all over my face eating all that.

There are vegan and dairy-free options. You can do sorbet in raspberry and mango varieties. You can also do frozen bars that looked delicious! The bars can also be dipped.

I'd come back for more. The sorbets and bars are next on my list. I also loved the gift baskets and ideas.

SERVICE:
After declining to be seated in the bar area, which they asked everyone as they waited to be seated, we were seated in the southern area of the restaurant. We figured out quickly that they were sitting families on the southern end, and older adults and seniors on the northern end. Therefore we were sitting among young, loud children. 

The first waiter took her time in getting us drinks and taking our food order, as we mentioned that we were not in a rush for a movie. She did not return, as when our appetizer came, she started serving two large groups of 10+ people, and a male waiter had our appetizer in hand. Neither came back to ask us how we were doing. The male took our plates when we were finished and gave us our bill.

FOOD:
The appetizer we ordered was the ""Four Cheese Spinach Dip."" It was really good - full of flavour. The ""fried pita chips"" that were mentioned on the menu were actually slices of warmed-up pita.

Mains:
1. Thai Curry Chicken Fingers - the menu mentioned that it came with red peppers, green onions, coconut, and green chili sauce. When it came to the table, there was no onion, and the coconut looked like melted cheese (on first taste though, it was definitely coconut). The other problem was that the chili sauce was only on the red pepper, therefore there was a limited amount. 

WARNING: This dish does not come with a free side. I added Sweet Potato Fries which was an additional $3.99.

2. ""No Meat"" Portobello Burger (gluten-free bun requested) - the mushroom was fried, therefore losing the great natural flavours. The goat cheese, red pepper, spinach, and aioli were limited, and if you removed the toppings from the bun, it was not even a lunch-sized salad. The bun itself was huge for the number of ingredients inside and it looked unappetizing. This dish came with a free side. The fries requested had too much potato.

THE BILL:
The male waiter said that he would remove the burger from the bill due to the issues discussed above. When the bill arrived, it had not been removed. We paid the bill and left a low tip.

NOTE: For those who keep strictly Kosher, the options are quite limited, so read the menu carefully. I had thought of getting the Balsamic Chicken, but the balsamic part was a cream sauce.",419,9/28/2017 2:13,FALSE,0.086333964

We called the location and informed them of the error. The staff member who answered the phone stated that they were not allowed to remake the food, as they were not allowed. As well, there was no way the food would be delivered. Not a sliver of understanding of the situation, empathy, or a desire to give a hint of customer service. When it was clear that nothing was going to be done to try and rectify the problem, we demanded a refund for the missing item. The staff members response, immediately hang up without another word.

So I had to call back, but low and behold, my calls went unanswered. I used another phone, and within two rings, wouldn't you know it, the same woman picked up!

I had asked immediately to speak to the on shift manager. I was told the manager was not in the store, and wouldn't be back for 30 minutes. This is at 630pm on a Saturday; I highly doubt that was the case. I asked who then was in charge, to which she stated that she was. I then had to take over being a manager and explain the basics of customer service to her. Such as showing empathy to someone's situation, offer solutions, such as a refund, and to not hang up on someone when they are asking for help and are not happy with what is being done. 

She stated that she did not hang up abruptly and that she was hung up on. I asked her if she said good bye, or if I had said goodbye. Silence was my only response. I asked again, and she finally replied that she thought the conversation was over after the refund was requested. That's fine, but you don't then hang up on someone and walk away. That might be how she conducts her personal life, but you don't do that at work. 

Finally an apology was offered and I was told that her manager, who is unavailable for 30 minutes, has processed the refund. Not sure how that was possible that the manager was around to process a refund, then disappear during a Saturday dinner rush, as the time between the initial phone call and the follow up was mere minutes. This manager should have a disappearing act as an illusionist. I took the apology and stated that how she conducts herself was far from appreciated.

We collectively agreed that this is our favourite location! 

The fish is a great size. If their pieces are small for the day, they will give you two pieces to compensate for the size difference. They let the fish drip for a bit so it's not usually as greasy as other places. I really enjoy their crunchy batter around the meaty fish! Their chips are thick and delicious as well.

Another visit:  this time I walked out without even being served.  SO disappointing after walking all the way there.   NO consistency in this place.

.............................................................

Please don't think me too fickle, but my most recent trip there was good.  The cook was nice and didn't mind my 10 requests for how I specifically wanted my breakfast prepared.

The breakfast was good.

...........................................

Below is how much I didn't like the servers the last time I was there:


This place has gone DOWNHILL!

In the past, it's been nice for a greasy bacon and egg breakfast - but the hacks working there now just aren't cut out for serving food.

I don't want to insult the rotund woman serving the food - but they need to widen the space behind the counter because she can't walk behind the counter without bouncing off it frequently and knocking things over on the serving counter.

And she is rather clueless as a server.  I didn't get the Coke that I asked for, and no Ketchup for the fries.  No toast.  It sat waiting to be toasted after she asked if I wanted brown bread or white.  And then - when I was done eating, and pushed my plate to the side and wanted to get the cheque - she just kept walking past me and walking past me and ..... ..... .....

And it would be nice if the cook did a little better timing his preparation.  I asked for fries for the second breakfast I ordered (OK - call me a pig) - because I couldn't stomach more than one bite of their pitiful excuse for fried potato mush (I guess they call that crud home fries or something - but it's about the most mushy, soggy, luke warm excuse for such a thing you'll ever see).  I mean that mess was WORSE than your usual crude they reheat to go with bacon and eggs.

But my mistake asking for fries meant that the rest of my food got cold sitting on a plate after the cook took the eggs and bacon off the grill to wait and wait and wait for the fries.

So the eggs and bacon arrive cold.  Thanks.

And the grunge in this place!!!!

Little flies sticking to a sign that hasn't been cleaned in years - and you don't - I mean you DON'T want to see the handle of their frying pan or the block they use to clean off the grill.

Some genius has taken rope of some kind and wrapped it around the handles on those two tools - and the handles are a disgusting grease soaked grungefest.

Someone really should grab a picture of what I'm talking about.  Sorry I didn't get a pic for you.  Because words can't begin to describe the completely grease soaked through dirty rope wrapped around the handles of the tools they use to prepare YOUR food.

There is NO WAY IN THE WORLD those two things could pass a health inspection visit.

Kim then calls me over and we start with the cut. For awhile, I'd get a one on the sides and a few inches of length on top with a straight razor hard line.

Kim is incredibly experienced and has the ability to diversify her craft and make me look great, regardless of hairstyle. She concludes the cut with a warm towel over the face, wash with shampoo and conditioner, neck shave with a straight razor, and massage.

While most Dollarama's retain the same visual identity and selection of products, this is a much weaker offering from the company. You know something's wrong when you walk in and are greeted by a sign warning you to watch your head when you walk down the stairs.

This location is cramped, underwhelming and feels very small. The Dollarama at Square One Shopping Centre spanks this - much bigger, much cleaner, with wider aisles and friendlier service, despite also being sub-ground level. I honestly thought I was in a different chain altogether when I went into the Spadina/Adelaide location.

I went in here looking for a couple of specific items, and was greeted by overstocked shelves, dumpy-looking presentation and visitors who looked like they'd rather be somewhere else. Everyone was rushing through the place knocking things around, and I decided that I didn't have the patience to bother any further with this.

And (of course) that was a homeless man sitting outside the entrance begging for change.

This place could be good if they modernized it a bit more - it seems like this is an older location and no one cares enough to bring it up to modern standards.

Storefront is located in a strip mall next to a patio furniture store and a few other strip mall staples. Plenty of parking right out front. The store itself is relatively large for a bbq and smoker only brick and mortar retailer. I was there for rubs so didn't spend much time on the hardware side of the store, but many different product lines on display including Traeger Pellet Smokers, Big Green Eggs and a seemingly wide range of outdoor kitchen setups and components. 

As soon as I walked in was greeted by friendly staff and proceeded to the ""back wall"" of goodness. A pretty wide range of rubs including some of the big, ubiquitous brands to more unique and even local choices. They had a nearly full line of Lane's BBQ, a bunch of Caribeque and several local products. Some, based on how easily they can get the product in, are open and marked as samples - which made trying some (but not all unfortunately) of the rubs I'd been curious about super easy. I've not seen this before in the other BBQ/smoking stores i've been to. I wish more would take this practice on as it's a great way to determine if you want to try a small bottle of something new, or, maybe buy something else's you might not have considered. I bought Loot and Booty What's Your Beef rub after trying it from the sample. Had there not been a sample, I probably would have passed it over. I recognize this is an extra inventory cost and cleanup cost for the store, but I applaud that they are trying to do this as much as possible - well done and my end sale from this visit doubled thanks to your investment here. 

Staff was very friendly - again as I was looking only at rubs and he like didn't get in to their knowledge around the various grills and outdoor kitchen set ups. But, in the rub space he guided me to some of the local products as well as some of his perspectives on others that I was considering. Totally zero pressure, all about the conversation which was also appreciated. 

They also had a really robust selection of different charcoals, some more mass market and others more bespoke and specialty. Same with the smoking woods, nothing super exotic but a good range of the 9 or so basics in a range of sizes. Lots of grill accessories as well.",449,5/19/2018 17:49,TRUE,0.088440164

The pieces of pork meat had no flavour, they were not flame toasted as other ramen places, and whats more it still had the piece of pork grind attached to it. Usually for ramen you cut the pork skin out. Also had to pay 1.5$ extra for the seasoned egg, and it also did not have much flavour. I love that egg in other places , like in Gagana Ramen, so i was looking forward to it. Then the spicy ramen did taste better, or I should say it has some flavour compared to the Shoyu Ramen, but unfortunately it does not come with pork slices but with grounded pork, lots of cabbage, I think it has kimchi as well.

I arrived here on Monday, 8/24/2015, the tail end of my short trip to Alberta, Canada. The Clarion hotel conference centre-Calgary Airport is one of those budget friendly hotels that caters to just about anyone: from the business traveler, to single travelers, couples, and families who want to sightsee in Calgary and beyond. The price point per night is roughly on the cheaper end: $70-$100 a night, which can be a great thing for budget minded travelers - like me. Here at the Clarion hotel conference centre - Calgary airport, it's pretty much a catch all in terms of what you want to do during your stay in Calgary. Whether you're passing through or planning an elaborate vacation, the Clarion Hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport can be your solution to your next big fling. For me, it was a place to rest my head before flying home. The proximity to Calgary airport from the Clarion hotel was about 5km, so it wasn't too bad at 4am - although finding a petro station that early near the airport terminal proved to be a challenge! Overall, my stay at the Clarion hotel and conference center was indeed a nice and satisfying one. 

If you are ever in the area and need a budget friendly and centralized place that's close to the airport, you should consider coming and staying here at the Clarion hotel & conference centre at Calgary airport. I received room 408 for the night of 08/24/2015 and didn't bother to ask for a wake up call for a 6:45am flight the next morning. The lobby was pretty nice and there was plenty of free parking around the complex. This Clarion hotel is location at 2120 16th Avenue NE and there are several restaurant options nearby. The lobby was nice and everything looked orderly, just empty. They accept major credit cards, so that's always a plus. The check in process was really good and fast. The service was quite good and the person who was checking me in had a smile on her face. That made me feel pretty good about my upcoming stay that night. After getting my room key, getting to the room was just an elevator ride to the 4th floor. 

The room itself was typical of any 2 star hotel room you would find anywhere in Canada and the USA. Everything was working, including the shower and television. The room was clean and the beds were comfortable, although I slept on one of them. Getting a room with a double bed was nice, but with a free night stay from Hotels.com, who am I to argue with free? I probably got 7 hours of sleep that night before checking out of the hotel and headed out to the airport for an early morning flight back to the USA and eventually home. For what it's worth, the Clarion Hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport is more than just a hotel that's in close proximity to the airport for those who need to be close to it for a quick entrance or exit.   Too bad it was just for a night here, otherwise, I'd be discovering more places in Calgary. If you are in the area and need a place to stay without breaking the bank, consider the Clarion hotel and conference centre - Calgary airport.

Comfortable stay and I would consider returning here, if my itinerary permits me to do so. Well worth it.

Support local!

I personally crave a nice big serving of oxtail with rice & peas often and now I can have it with less guilt.  Same goes poutine.  Plus, you gotta love the warm and enthusiastic vibe of the people who work here.  

Though not on their regular menu (yet), they serve a mean poutine.  Like I said, it's more of a guilt-free type poutine with fresh cut fries, fried in coconut oil.  I personally only use coconut oil when I cook so I was excited about this.  The fries was then topped with some oxtail gravy, mixed veggies (yes, veggies!) and cheese.  The cheese wasn't your regular cheese curds, which I personally prefer (if you've read my other reviews, you'd know of my love of dem squeaky cheese).  Though the cheese added some nice saltiness to the poutine, it didn't melt well in the middle of the meal.  Was basically a blob of hardened warm cheese. Was like eating some Saganaki but on the tougher, chewier side. Perhaps they should have at least shredded the cheese while spreading it more throughout the layers of fries instead of just on top? The mixed veggies which entailed rapini, onions and bell pepper, were also a nice topping.  Gave a nice crunch and added a unique flavour. Though I'm not a huge fan of rapini due to its bitterness, the other vegetables helped contrast the flavour so it was really good.  Was so good that I ate it all.  

As for the oxtail gravy, I wish it were a little more on the thicker side.  With its runnier texture, the fries became a little too soggy.  I did also order oxtail with rice to-go and the oxtail was delicious.  Again, I wish the sauce/gravy was thicker, but it was still flavourful.  Personally, I love having the sauce/gravy on its own while dipping some fresh fried dumplings (which they unfortunately do not have. Or maybe not yet).

I was immediately taken aback by the amount of product and sections in this store. It is packed full of almost any piece of outdoor gear I could want. So I began by navigating around and identifying the sections I needed to concentrate on for a christmas gift or two. FYI I ended up walking out with half a dozen gifts and many ideas for items I wanted myself. 

The front of the store has baselayers, coats, and technical clothing, turn left and you're into more clothing based on season I believe. Around the check-out counter there are climbing gear counters and knives, camping gadgets. I saw some rope and packs of quickdraws that I really wanted as well as a new belay device. One more room back looks like the fisherman's wharf of fishing gear if that makes any sense. There was a lot and I don't know much about fishing to begin talking about it. They did have kayaks, and a few really cool ones. 

I spent most of my time around the camping and backpacking gear to the right of all of this. There is also a clearance area in the way back. If the middle of this area is a small bookcase with tons of great camping and backpacking resources, maps, novels, guides, etc.

Consider St. Sharbel as an Eastern Catholic Church, where there are still main components as the Roman Catholic Church, the only difference is that the language that is used in some of the responses are in Aramaic (Jesus' language).

My grandma brought me here, as she has been visiting this church since Easter. She loves the sermons and the fact that this parish uses Aramaic within their masses. The church is nestled within a neighborhood, where there is still development going on. The hall is quite large, while the church is somewhat in transition as it is just a huge bungalow (the parish is raising money to build a nice church). But the decor of the church-bungalow was not your typical Roman Catholic design. The stone work reminded my grandmother of Jerusalem (where she happened to travel back in the day for a pilgrimage), while the use of incense was abundant throughout the mass. Most of the parishioners were Filipino, Italian, Lebanese, Hispanic and Indian. 

It was my first Aramaic-English mass that I've ever attended. I liked how there was a flat screen so you can read-along to what the readings and the responses were. Overall, if I lived in the area, I wouldn't mind attending mass here as it is quite different than your traditional Roman Catholic churches!",226,12/6/2012 0:47,TRUE,1

They are located in a small industrial plaza on Brimley, north of Sheppard. They have seating for less than 20 diners, with most of their business being takeout and catering. Looking past the service counter reveals a huge kitchen plus another area where they smoke the foods. The back of house space looks to be easily four to five times large than the front of house.

What makes this place different from most Jamaican/Caribbean restaurants is their claim to offer healthier choices. To support this claim, they make all their own seasonings, with a lower salt content and all natural ingredients. Their marinades are bottled and available for purchase at the counter. They use chickens that are grain fed and locally grown.

Their daily menu offers Jerk Chicken, Jerk Pork, BBQ Chicken, Stew Chicken, Curry Chicken, and Fish. The fish has to be ordered two hours in advance. Weekly specials include a different soup every day, Curry Goat on Wednesdays, Cow Foot on Thursdays, and Oxtail on Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays only.

My companion and I ordered small plates of Jerk Pork, Oxtail, and Stew Chicken in order to sample a few dishes. They were all served with Rice & Peas and a Veggie Medley (steamed).

Our plates arrived with generous portions of rice & peas and veggies and a decent amount of proteins (for small orders).

The jerk pork looked good, with a nice smoke ring around the edges. It tasted okay but it was dry and the seasoning hadn't penetrated the meat as much as the smoke. They probably used a leaner, ""healthier"" cut of meat instead of a more marbled (fattier) cut. Some gravy would have probably improved this dish (for me).

The stew chicken, with an ample amount of gravy, was also okay and appeared to be all skinless dark meat.

The oxtail was our favourite dish. It was the most flavourful of the three and tender enough to come off the bone easily.

Overall, I admire their efforts to offer healthier cooking but I would have to describe the taste as average. I've had better and I've had worse but I don't know if I've had healthier (from a Caribbean restaurant). The service was friendly.",389,5/19/2019 16:27,FALSE,0.112469927

The location is very convenient, being super close to the movie theaters. 

The service was excellent, the food was tasty, even though we waited quite a bit for it to arrive. 

Me and my hubby split the ""big smoker plate"", which is a set of ribs, a build your own pulled pork half sammy, breaded shrimp and a full in-house smoked chorizo sausage. It is all served with in-house baked cornbread, coleslaw and seasoned fries.

It was plenty of food for two, in my opinion, but there is a larger option for 2 to split, if you are really hungry. 

Again, the food was delicious, but I am not sure why we waited so long, since there was almost no one at the restaurant when we arrived. It started to fill in quite a bit, when we were leaving.

The best part, is that they drive me to work in one of their cars, not mine, so not to use up all of my gas :)  Also, they either pick me up if at the end of the day, or even drop my car off to me if in the middle of the afternoon, so I don't have drive back to work.

The courtyard is flourishing with aged trees and plantery, it's right behind Vegas' best park (in my opinion), and the interior of the apartments I thought were very charming. My mind has definitely changed. How can I even describe the hell I am living in. I just had a baby and my apartment is infested with cockroaches. I put in a work order for pest control, that we pay for monthly mind you, and it was just some maintenance guy with, what I am assuming, is store bought crap poison, because it didn't work at all. Very disappointing. The roaches didn't even look sick in the slightest. They are still everywhere. I will be calling them again to complain. I don't understand why we pay for pest control when it's just some guy using crap poison. In that case it should be free like most places. 

The post below is very much accurate when it comes to noise. The people next door let all the neighborhood teenagers hang out at their place. They are outside being very loud at all hours of the night. And I mean, they yell, bang on things, blast music on their phones and more. The father of my child has told them to be quiet many times and we have also called the cops. Nothing has helped. They should be evicted. It goes against the lease. It's sad that all summer I have been cooped up in the apartment paying an arm and a leg for air conditioning. Now that it's cool I can't even keep my windows open to enjoy it. When it's daytime, small children are so loud playing outside. At night, the bigger children come out to play. The small children are actually quieter than they are. I wake up all throughout the night, angry and frustrated, when I have to wake up very early in the morning. Security does nothing. I will be making more complaints. I doubt they will do much though. Seems like one of the people that live there work with the apartments anyway. 

The appliances are old. The washer and dryer are old and the buttons don't line up to the settings. I have to turn it to some random setting to get a decent wash. The dishwasher is old too. The fridge open into the wall. I can barely open the produce drawer, and the shelf attachments always falls off and all my condiments fall to the floor. More complaints On the upside, maintenance has been ok. They are pretty quick at getting things done. I will most certainly be putting in more work orders. However, the pest control will need a professional. I have already made plans for that. 

All in all, I want to move out as quickly as possible and will. They have certainly lost themselves a long time tenant. Would I suggest this place to anyone? No. Absolutely not. What hell I am living in right now. Would not wish that upon anyone else.",516,10/18/2016 4:23,FALSE,0.120783036

I think the owners are Korean as they carry lots of Korean foods and the majority of their prepared meals are Korean. 

I have fond memories of Eden from when I was living in Montreal, first as a poor and starving undergrad, then as a poorer and more starving grad student, lol. I would typically buy my groceries at Segal's Market and Marche Lobo, but when I had some extra money (i.e. after my birthday and Christmas) I would splurge at Eden. 

I love their baked goods display. Seeing knishes, arancini, empanadas, Jamaican patties, and samosas all together in one display is so symbolic of the cultural mosaic that is Canada. 

The sushi at Eden, although pre-packaged, is very good (for grocery store sushi) and much cheaper than at Loblaws and other such places. 

The grocery store is very clean and well lit. Staff are nice. There have been a few renovations over the years and it's much more modern looking now than when I lived in Montreal. There will always be a special place in my heart for Eden ;)",216,12/24/2018 2:51,TRUE,0.081265645

I ordered a corned beef sandwich, minus the coleslaw (it was $11.95) and it was a good sandwich.  It was served on light rye bread.  There were two bottles of mustard on the table (regular and dijon) so you can put as much or as little as you want.  The bread was soft and fresh and the meat was warm and tasty.

I felt like something sweet and saw lemon meringue tarts in the fridge and couldn't resist (it was $6.95).  It was a good tart.  The lemon wasn't too sweet.  It arrived showier than I expected.  The ice cream and strawberry were a nice surprise and the jam was a bit too sweet.

These people will force every penny from you. When I first came to the office here I was told I was only paying rent of $840 and I had to give proof of gas and energy that would be in my name. It wasn't until the day of the lease signing, the day I was to move in, and the day it was too late to move anywhere else that they told me I had to pay water, sewer, trash, and pest. It wasn't on the listing, and it wasn't what we agreed to at the initial meeting. NO ONE mentioned it. By that time, what what I supposed to do? Back out? Be homeless? So, I agreed and thought, 'screw it, I'm out in a year'.

That all being said, apparently the water bill is due today, and the ladies at the office are stone cold as ever. They talk to you like you're below them. They were all chipper when they were luring me into this awful place, but after that, no one has ever been polite or welcoming. Anyhow, I just walked in there today to give them my rent. I was rudely asked if I was going to pay my water bill. First off, water, sewer, trash, pest fluctuates each month. I received a letter YESTERDAY from some creep lurking outside my door stating that the building was going under new management (which hopefully means job layoffs for the office staff). The letter stated that the online payment portal was deactivated and that a utility bill will be sent each month. Sure enough, the site was deactivated. So, I guess a bill was to be expected. I know that my rent is $840. So, since I can't see a balance owed on the site that is deactivated, I will pay my rent and wait for my bill. Seriously, this broad looked at me like I was scum. Actually, they don't really look at you. They look through you and away a lot. They rarely look you in the eye. What for? You're scum to them. I asked her what the balance was, because she didn't even offer to tell me. She just looked at me like I was a homeless person bumming change and that I should be aware of my imposing nature upon her almighty most likely underpaid self.

I'm so ready to get out of here. I hope the new management company cleans house and finds admins whom can actually interact with the human population.

The breakfast bar [which also doubles as the hotel bar] wasn't much: powdered eggs, sausage, juice, make your own waffles, toaster, bread, bagels, oranges, jams, and coffees, oatmeal packets. Bagels did the job for me.

I work on the same street as this mom and pop shop and was used to seeing the famous Wisey's Pie in the exact location where Urbun Eats is now. This is a relatively new business in the Leaside area, and I think it's got memorable qualities to make it a lasting gem. By that, I am specifically pointing to the service and quality of food.  

Upon entering, you will be greeted with a smile  by a boy who seems to be the son of the family running the place. This kid's got emotional labour and customer service down, that's for sure!  I like to know my options and thus tend to be the type to ask several questions to pinpoint my food selection. Even so, he handled it all with ease without any hesitation and was a careful listener.  You could honestly tell that he cares for the customer and has a good work ethic when it comes to providing stellar customer service. 

The food also has a magnitude of its own, mind you. I got the Urbun Smoke, which the boy recommended among other interesting items, with the Standard Combo. The Urbun Smoke was about 13 dollars and the Standard Combo, which included fries/onion rings and a pop, was 3 dollars.  Their burgers are priced at the gourmet tier, which may turn some potential diners away, but their quality of meats and portion size are their trump cards. Take a look at my burger - It. Is. Massive! I sent a photo to my friends and the size was all they kept talking about! 

Their variety is also refreshing. When you order a burger, you choose one of three buns: regular, seeded, and brioche. The family members are also helpful in advising about the best bun selection for the particular burger you're ordering, so don't sweat it.  I think the brioche bun would put a sweet spin on a chicken burger, so I'm eager to try that combination next.  In fact, I might like it more than chicken and waffles! Meat-wise, my Urbun Smoke had Montreal smoked meat in it and it tasted far better than bacon in a burger! The AAA beef patty was also not overcooked. Rather, I think it was medium to medium well done because I still had some pink patches in my patty. This ensured that each mouthful was soft rather than chewy.  This is gourmet burgers done right.

Right now, it's a hole in the wall type of joint, but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets its own hype when the area becomes busier after the LRT is finished. It's got all the works going for it anyway:

1. Customer service with a Can Do attitude

2. Portions that don't leave you hanging when you run out of cash to buy seconds 

3. Well-cooked and flavourful meats 

4. A type of bun for any mood",494,9/1/2017 23:15,TRUE,1

You can order at the cashier or at the table. The food came out super fresh and super delicious. Traditional music was playing the whole time which was cool. 

I love going to ME places especially Mandi restaurants; they remind me so much of Dubai! 

This was a great experience. I'm glad we came here for lunch today! So yummy! 



Isn't it great when you find food from Yemen all the way in the valley? I sure felt glad! 
Having lived in Dubai all my life, I grew up fond of this kind of food, Mandi, Mathbi, Madfoon, Bukhari, etc. Yemeni and Saudi food in Dubai was and still is very popular and is known for delicious taste, huge portions, and very reasonable (sometimes even cheap) prices. 
We were referred to this restaurant by a family member. Not sure how she found out about it bcz she never tried it so far but we, my husband and I, decided to give it a shot and head there. We arrived at around 12:45pm. We expected to find some people when we walked in but it was empty. Not a problem. The first thing that I would say is probably the only major negative in this place is the smell. My husband was about to take me some where else bcz I was getting uncomfortable. As you walk in, you are hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals that do not smell good at all. I am not sure what the reason is but I decided to just ignore the smell and order and go in as soon as possible bcz the smell was mostly only at the entrance. 
I ordered the goat mandi and my husband ordered the lamb with rice dish. We were asked to pick a seat either on the table or in the traditional Arabic section and they would bring out the food. We also were offered to get our drinks from the fridge. 
We decided to sit in the Arabic Jalsa area since there was no one there. The food came out in a reasonable time - about 10 min and it looked great. The meat was in the center of the dish with some browned onions on top, both dishes looked very inviting. The food was served with a lime wedge, some cucumber yogurt and a green chili sauce on the side. We dug in and the food was delicious! I was so glad at that point that my husband did not insist on making us leave and that I was able to survive the entrance and try this good food. The meat was delicious and very tender and the rice was cooked to perfection. Portion size as always in these restaurants was just right. Having not had breakfast, I finished my dish and of course my husband did too. 
After eating this great meal we left feeling drowsy lool, a typical feeling after you have such a good big rice meal  
We paid at the entrance just before we left and the price was $39 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks. Slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. 
I hope they will find a solution for the smell in this place because the food and the service are so good, it would be a shame if ppl decide not to come in because of that.",587,8/25/2018 23:19,TRUE,0.145814153

Barista was polite but there was only her at both cash and making drinks, so it took a lil longer than most bbt. Not unacceptably slow though.
The peach oolong was a huge miss for me, you taste no peach and all oolong. The oolong part isn't bad, tea was strong but not bitter, but I really wanted the fruity notes as a nice summer drink.
The cheese Oreo one was a very pleasant surprise. I was at first very confused by the idea of cheese in my drink...like mozzarella? Cheddar? Mascarpone? So it actually tastes like LIQUID CHEESE CAKE. The drink was very smooth, rich cheesy taste. I tasted faint savoury notes but nothing repulsive. There was too little Oreo in ours, the bits added really nice texture to the drink, just wish there was more of it so you get some in every sip.

Thankfully everything checked out and Dr. A explained that because this was a slightly stronger prescription than I was used to that headaches were normal and to be expected.

This has to do with the all you can eat fish places that we go to with regularity - Mentor Family Restaurant, Lakeshore Eatery, Mama Roberto's and Manhattan Deli.  

The fish tastes great at all of these places and the price is not unreasonable.  All give a good portion on the first plate.  It's thereafter that we have an issue.  One piece every 20 minutes - some a little better, some a little worse.  Those that ask how many you want, take longer.  

The management and owners need to take some things into consideration.  For our family, one person gets AYCE and the rest of us order from the menu.  That means 1-4 profit makers in our party of up to five.  We also come in at other times and spend money.  

The slow down only serves to make our fish eater stubborn and he isn't afraid to tell the wait staff what he wants, especially when he isn't getting it.  I'm sure the wait staff hate AYCE fish.  Tonight we had a different tactic to the slow down.  They ran out of fish. I have very rarely been at a place that runs out of anything.

I am sure we are not the only ones disappointed in this situation.  Again, I ask that management take some time to rethink how we can make everyone happy.

First my appointment was pushed off 15 minutes because they were behind schedule, so I actually had to reschedule a meeting I had planned that day. (They did contact and let me know a few hours in advance, and blamed it on clients being late, but typically places end on time even when clients are late instead of inconveniencing people planning to show up--and leave--on time.)

I think what happened was that they didn't take enough time with the intake and picked a product that wasn't appropriate for my skin type. They do use all natural products, but clearly the incorrect product for someone's skin can cause damage, and I expect professionals to match the product to the individual (rather than blaming it on ""the environment, overuse of harsh ingredients, certain medications, autoimmune diseases, and aggressive treatments"")--my skin has never reacted sensitively to other facials, because the aestheticians did a good job of matching product to my skin type. Then to compensate for using the incorrect product which, apparently, damaged my skin's barrier, they switched up the second mask planned to one that left my skin super oily for at least an hour, so I had to cancel the meeting altogether. Kind of odd for a facial marketed as one that you can get and go back to work/your day afterwards... I imagine people don't show up to work meetings with thick layers of oil on their skin.

Being given the understanding and compassion at a very heartbreaking moment in your life goes a long way with me.

Last but absolutely not least, remember that second room? The next morning, we went to go use the shower in the second room because the other one was broken and was told that the hotel already checked us out! We're all, ""Uhh checkout isn't til twelve.

I had the worse experience with them Yesterday and I will never buy anything else from them. I bought a bedroom set for my 8 year old daughter, the set came yesterday. They put half of the bed together and while they were doing that the 3rd driver tried to take the desser off the truck by himself. I heard a crack from the kitchen I thought to myself they are going to tell me there's a scratch, Scratch was an understatement. The whole top of the dresser came apart and the screws were coming up. The driver says you can keep the dresser and we will order another one. I said to him are you crazy I should leave a broken dresser in my 8 year olds room to get hurt, No I am refusing it. Also they did not have the Canopy for my baby's bed, 2 strikes. So I called the store. The sales person tells me I have to come to the store to redo the paper work for the financing. I don't live right around the corner so I went to the store of course pissed. I get there the sales lady was nonchalant really didn't care so we go straight to the computers where they finish the orders. All of them were nonchalant, not empathetic to the situation, they hear me ranting and raving and absolutely nothing. The finance people had everything right on their end, It was the store that screwed up everything. You can't just try to sell merchandise you have to take time to go through your orders to make sure you give your customers exceptional service. So I said you guys inconvenienced me I had to burn gas for something that could have been done over the phone, I should be compensated with a discount off this order.

d_QwF-OkraLnrmbDo2d8Ng,EOUq_p5XhVkF8U85AUJ1gg,_ESPB65ASmY9hBHflX2fnA,1,3,1,1,"I came into Pho Saigon St with my dad after reading the reviews on Yelp and after hearing it from my friend who claimed: ""this was the best new pho restaurant in the area"".

My dad and I got seated right away and we ordered the Bun Bo Hue, crispy spring rolls and a bowl of house special Pho.

15 minutes passed and we first got our spring rolls. These were really delicious! Probably what I love most about this restaurant. They are extremely crispy, freshly made and it also comes with a large chunk of pickled carrot, which was also refreshing to cleanse our palate. 

Five minutes after we got our spring rolls, we got a large bowl of pho and a small bowl of pho. My dad and I were confused since we never ordered the large bowl of pho - we ordered the Bun Bo Hue. So we notified the waitress that there must have been a mix-up and she said she'll double check for us about our order.

About five minutes or so went by and the waitress never got back to us about the status of my dad's bowl. In fact, she was taking other people's orders and didn't look us in the eye as she walked by our table. It was only after another waitress came by, saw my dad not eating the pho and asked us what was wrong. When we told her that there was a mix-up, she looked surprised (which gave me the assumption that the previous waitress never told anyone about our mix-up) and immediately got our order in. So we had to wait another 15 minutes for my dad's food to finally come.

My dad's bowl finally came in and he wasn't very pleased with the order. There was quite a bit of soup in comparison to noodles, and there wasn't anything special about it, either. It tasted like overly citrus spicy soup. I thought the house special Pho tasted good, but I didn't think it was worth the $8.50 price tag. The portion is quite big and they provided a good amount of noodles and meat in my bowl, but I also specifically asked for extra green onions (which was not fulfilled, unfortunately).

As someone who works in customer service, I can empathize that sometimes things can easily slip out of your head as you get multiple requests from different customers all at once, especially if you're new to working in the service industry. However, it bothered me how we were simply ignored by the first waitress about our problem. We were never given any follow-up and after 5-10 minutes of waiting ""for our bowl to come"" it seemed like nothing was done about it. If the second waitress had not asked us about our problem, I don't think we would have gotten my dad's bowl. I would have appreciated a simple explanation from the waitress - it feels uneasy being left out in the dark and not knowing what is going on.

We were given a 10% discount for the mishap, which I noticed, but the lack of communication and the typical taste of the food made me feel unenthusiastic to give this restaurant a good tip after we left. I definitely would like to come back again and give it another shot, because I have a feeling it was a pure accident rather than this restaurant being bad overall. 

There are definitely great points about this restaurant, like their cleanliness, great tasting spring rolls and large portions of meals... I'm really hoping my next visit will be better!",602,12/17/2017 0:52,FALSE,0.128831228

The designer accessories are plopped (and chained) onto the shelves and you have to hunt around for someone if you want something and then put up with their fake attempt to be genuinely interested in you. Since this is a smaller store their selection is somewhat limited.

Their shoe corner has a pitiful selection of Louboutin, Prada, Dior and Jimmy Choo's - but if you are really looking for shoes either head over to David's in the mall or go down to Holt's on Bloor St.

dAORkoUJcmnXARxaJnpe3g,0xiX3PVkh2WoqZb423AcjA,_FALYkjieEE8IZGHslUcNA,1,2,2,1,"Not so delicious. My experience with this restaurant has insured that I will never eat here again. 

We wanted to have a specific Thai dish and needed delivery and after looking this was what I found. When I called the man who answered barely spoke or understood English but apparently he's the only one who can take orders. It took five mins for him to get my address, phone number, name and credit card right.

On there menu it says that you can pick how spicy you want your dish. I asked the man to please make my orders mild (which everything was) and Colin's order extra spicy. I repeated extra spicy a number of times and asked specifically once if his would be extra spicy. He never at any point during my order said he could not do this. In fact he said ok. I also asked for our order without red and green bell peppers( which are sweet and not spicy in any way). I also read what the menu listed as ingredients and asked if anything else was in the dish. He told me no and i told him it was very important that it came the way it was in the menu with no extras and he promised it would. After repeating the order to him multiple times he still repeated it back wrong. Still we worked it out and got off the phone.

A short time later the food came. So I will say that the delivery time was reasonable.   The bill reflected a different price then the menu on their OWN website. We don't care that much about price but many will. Everything we ordered was at least a dollar more than on their menu. When you order a few items that can add up. Plus when the food is mediocre it's not worth the price. The food is made with cheap ingredients and popping with the cheap stuff while very sparce on the ingredients you expect to see for the price. The restaurant boasts authentic food while three out of four of the items we ordered were nothing like the authentic dishes.

We opened our dinner and it looked nothing like the authentic Thai dish I have made and we have ordered from other Thai restaurants. Plus it had cheap from frozen veggies filling the container, after we were promised no extra crap.  Colin's dinner was as mild as they come and not extra spicy.

I picked up the phone and called them right away. I told him our dinner had extra veggies and Colin's dinner was very mild. The man tells me first that we asked not to get red or green bell peppers so they added the veggies. I told him I specifically asked him not to and he agreed. He says it's the way that dish is made. I KNOW this is not true and tell him his dish is nothing like the authentic dish and plus the authentic dish does not have frozen veggies in it. Then I say plus Colin's dinner was very mild not spicy. He says that without the bell peppers it won't be spicy. To which obviously I remind him that bell peppers are sweet. Then he says that you cant get that dish in anything but mild and I am mistaken about the spice option printed in a huge square on their menu. I told him this was not good customer service and he had told me we could have extra spicy and that the dishes would not have extra ingredients. 

He responds with; and this deserves it's own paragraph because it's important that people read it; ""well then don't order food from us then"". I have worked in service jobs and I would NEVER tell a customer to shop somewhere else if they are being calm and have a valid complaint. In fact I wouldn't even say it if a person were rude. I was calm and polite in making my complaint and the man was rude and offered nothing but arguments and insults. 

In my reviews over the years you will see that even if a place was not so great, I want to go back and give it another chance and that I will still point out a positive. Delicious Thai is mediocre, over priced food with a rude and completely unprofessional staff. I will not be going back and I will be telling everyone I meet not to as well.

They are always so on the ball with upcoming events, are readily stocked with new decorations for either valentines day, halloween, christmas - you name it, they are ready to sell it weeks in advance. It sure beats buying expensive stuff at a department store if it's a one-time use.

I have to say that this place is best for GUM.

While the lower level employees were nice, I can't say the same the about the rest.  Not only was the apartment I rented a wreak, it looked like someone had destroyed that apartment and all they did was lay some paint on the destruction, but they were unwilling to work with us when we needed it most. While understanding that business is business having compassion should still be apart of humanity even in business. We had our banking information stolen as well as all our money. We had to borrow beg and work extra hard to get our bills paid. We tried to let the office know what was going but it was you still need to pay on time or pay hundreds in late fees. We were already paying extra for things that didn't get paid due to payments being returned. It took months to get our money back but by then the damage was done and we were so far behind on everything it was hard to keep up week to week. We had been able to have a little flex money before all this but after it was worse than check to check. Having a family of four eating ramen tuna and rice was horrible I was glad that my kids got more options to eat at school. The weeks before Christmas were hard. We had to tell the kids that we would not be having Christmas but it was okay we could pay rent and I would make it up to them. My son then broke his arm and that made paying on time impossible. I went to the office and I told them, please I need a bit more time I went to court and no one cared. I was forced out of my home two days before Christmas even though I told them I needed a week to make up the money. Fine, they did what they did. we are getting back on our feet we are doing better and I get a call. They want the rent not just from the month we couldn't pay but the three months left in our lease plus late fees. I told them it will take a few months before I will have enough in my budget to pay the $400 a month they want. I was told they would note it in the file. That's it not can you make a lower payment just pay now all or $400 a month. Something I can't do I have loans to pay off from the fiasco of before. They call back two weeks later. asking if now I could pay. I tell them the same thing I asked if I could wait till after summer we should be better off then and things would be paid off. I would have more flexibility. They said they would note the account. I get a call from them again telling me if I don't make a payment soon I will be sent to a lawyer where I will not only pay almost double but also all the legal fees. All I asked was a few months I don't want to have this hanging over my head I want to pay and they do this. I'm trying really hard to keep within my budget and not overspend and they are making so I will end up in the same situation spending more than I have. I'm so angry and disappointed. Why are they pushing this so hard? And here is the kicker. I had called months ago when I had fewer bill and asked what was a good payment plan and the number I was given to call said they didn't have any information on my account. They just started calling me about it last month. It is really discouraging to know people care so little about others and only care about their pockets.

The food was quite good. I had the katsudon and could tell that they are using the correct Japanese recipe. The pork was tender, the onions done right and the rice cooked to 'don' perfection. The spinach was delicious. One can taste the seasoning in it. Upon request they also brought katsu sauce for me. The salad side and miso soup were also welcome with the former enjoying a refreshing dressing.
My friend had a Hiyashi Chuka (cold ramen noodles) and found it okay. Hiyashi chuka could come with a clear, sesame or soy broth and she was disappointed that she did not get her favourite sesame broth. Nothing wrong with her noodle dish, but this version was not her favourite. Moreover, they mix the noodle in while others may keep the noodle separate. I had a Hiyashi Chuka years ago at their original location and remembered how the Saga-born waitress had recommended it. They always promoted cold ramen there in the summer and seem to do so here as well. Also, was it my imagination? They used to add ham to Hiyashi Chuka there. Not here. They stick with pieces of regular pork. The egg was well done.

I recall how the original location's waitresses were Japanese every time I went. It was not the case here. The waitress' answers and accent tells me she was not Japanese. She was polite and kind regardless.",348,6/30/2019 19:27,FALSE,0.094820145

My car had a bunch of problems, coolant leak, oil leak, misfires etc. Most mechanics couldn't really handle a job this big, they didn't have the knowledge and skill to handle a job like mine. I needed a professional, someone who knows the Audi design and how it all fits together. I took it to one shop for a diagnostic and they jacked up my car and busted a control arm bushing. The mechanic didn't know that the Audi wasn't designed to be jacked up in that location. Great learning experience for him but now I drive away with a clunk clunk coming from my front wheels, awesome. They of course plead ignorance but it comes in with no noise and leaves with a noise. I was frustrated, were all mechanics in Arizona money laundering, untrained grease monkeys? Was there an actual mechanic in town?

Then I found Mike and his team at Arizona Import Specialists. I dropped my car off there and they took a swing at it. I know cars and pretty much knew by then what needed to be done and Mike gave me an 100% accurate estimate for the job. No bull just a straight up, this is what I want to fix and this is what it will cost. When you have an old car a lot of mechanics try to tack on useless fixes to increase the value of the repair invoice, not AIS. These guys are so experienced they pretty much just drove my car 10 feet and popped the hood and knew what was wrong in about 5 minutes, that is when I knew these were the guys to do the job. There wasn't 3 guys with flashlights poking around my car, ""Ohh maybe its this!"".

Once I approved the job they did the work. Next day I picked the car up and pulled away, it felt brand new. The manual transmission, 2.8 liter V6 stuttered into the shop but when it left, it left with attitude.  I had finally found a place that can work on a car.

Mentor Oh.

How can you not love a place that gives you a plate of house made pickles when you sit down. Yumm.

We have herd about the Manhattan Deli from numerous friends that live in Mentor, so when we were at Roma's last hair appointment, we thought we'd drop in since it is right down the street form L&G.

When you first walk in, you see the classic deli counter with meats and prepared foods for purchase to take home. Corn beef, pastrami, Latka, ext. along with baked good and pastries.

Our waitress, Rhonda was a very pleasant and polite mature woman who was very informative and insightful of the menu and specials. She also came to the table with the plate of delicious pickles, so in my book she's awesome!

Since this was our first time, naturally I had a little tasting of many things to truly give an accurate depiction of our dining experience.

For starters, we ordered a hummus plate, zucchini sticks, and a huge Greek salad. 

The hummus was almost inedible, I don't know if it was the tahini or the citrus, but it did not taste anything like hummus, and it came with pre-packaged squares of pita that were so dry they were almost rubbery. 

The zucchini stick were thick spears coated in a crunchy thin breading, these were probably some of the best I had ever had. I could eat these all day. 

Roma and I shared the Greek salad; small baby olives, oil and vinegar, cucumbers, red onions, and a pile of feta. Pretty tasty!

For the main course we ordered Beef Shawarma, Falafel, and Latka. 

The beef was thin strips, over cooked with old seasoning caked on each strip. Even with all the seasoning, they had very little if no flavor at all. Sitting on a pile of chopped iceberg lettuce with pickled beets and a side of tahini, Yikes that's alotta salad!

I was so looking forward to having the falafel, but man what a disappointment. Again, they were so dry, I almost had to dip them in my water just to ensure I could digest them. No flavor what so ever.

Then there was the Latka, another disappointment. Yes it was cooked fresh, and yes it looked delicious. But they were bitter and almost sour tasting. Even with some apples sauce, I couldn't eat them.

The saving grace for this experience was the desert. Roma had the lemon cheesecake, and I had the carrot cake. Both were absolutely delicious, but wouldn't you know, they weren't even made by the restaurant, they buy them from a local bakery. Surprise!

I guess this is all do to my willingness to be daring, and seeking some true ethnic cuisine. Everyone that suggested this place recommended the brisket, or the pastrami. I wish we would have stuck with that. I am not writing this place off yet. I will be going back and trying some of the more popular dishes.

I always have to get the ""Unwhich"" because I can't have gluten. I got a Club Lulu Unwhich which is the sandwich I always get. Usually I am full after eating this sandwich so I don't order chips. Before even opening it it seemed lighter than usual. I open it up and it looks like a slim sandwich. Hardly any meat and the contents were just very minimal. I'm a small person and I ate the whole sub and was still hungry. I had to eat some of my sons chips and get a drink refill to feel full. It was very disappointing. Also the music was so loud in there that I couldn't really relax and enjoy my food. I feel like either Jimmy Johns cut back on the amount of meat they put in their sub or else the locations aren't consistent. You get more meat in a sub at Subway and it's cheaper.

Cute nail salon, conveniently located near the metro & some shopping. I dropped in with 2 guy friends and they were able to accommodate all of us at the same time within 5 minutes (just long enough to pick nail polish colours!). The space is bright and airy with a chandelier. 

The owners are Vietnamese. Like most nail salons, the staff mostly just talk to each other in Vietnamese (I always wonder what they're saying! ""omg, look at this girl's calluses!""), although they were very friendly, asking us where we were from/what we were doing in Montreal, etc. I think it's a family-run business, because the guy who did my nails was really young. Also, this was the first time I've had my nails done by a dude! He was very meticulous and did a good job, although the salon got really busy and there were lots of people waiting by the time I left. I think he felt rushed during my manicure and the polish ended up with tiny air bubbles (this has happened to me before, and sometimes it depends on the particular polish but usually I notice it when they put the 2nd coat on too fast). I also smudged one of my nails while taking out my wallet. He fixed it with an extra coat, but it still ended up uneven. When you're getting a pedicure, you get to sit in a big massage chair and watch TV. The foot massage was nice, although they use this strange blue gel product instead of the usual foot cream. 

Colour selection was just okay. They had all the crazy and trendy colours (blues, yellows, greens, etc.) but relatively few pinks, corals, and reds. They carry mostly OPI. They also do shellac. 

Overall, fast and friendly. But I wasn't totally satisfied with the results. NB: Cash Only (there is an ATM in the salon).",317,8/5/2011 4:55,TRUE,1

Dr. Tang examined my boyfriend's eyes today and just by witnessing the procedure, it was one of the most thorough, most detailed and carefully done eye examinations I have ever seen, and I've witnessed quite a number of these at other eye doctors. The rooms she has in this business are all set up quite nicely and there is a lot of information at each station for the benefit and education of patients while they are in the process of waiting. The eye exam went smoothly and it seems Dr. Tang carefully sanitizes each tool she uses and makes sure they are acceptable to use on her patients. As I said, I've never seen such a thorough examination. She did things that my eye doctor has never done, which now makes me question him. She checked every part of the eye, making sure everything was healthy and regular. She put in eyedrops to dilate the eye for further examination of the inner eyeball- which was so cool because I've never even heard of this process.

f_PHRTAUNcLhBl3HIVvxRg,AQ68GdYacVeqqqroAh9eOA,_eRcc1OFDbi3fnVBskXP9g,4,2,0,0,"In his book ""Save the Deli"", David Sax discusses the rise and fall of delicatessen culture in North America and beyond. He points to the challenges in defining a 'real deli', and the increasingly high economic barriers to sustained success. 

Mr. Sax describes several delis which have stood the test of time; those that have been lost to history, and some which have tried against the odds to resurrect what seems like a dying approach to food. 

Since he wrote his book, some of his examples have thrived, while others blossomed only to wither and ultimately fail. 

Zelden's is a funny example. It began life decades ago, as ""Zeli's Deli"" up in the wilds of Thornhill. Facing intense competition from several similar restaurants, it eventually closed. The food was fine; the ambiance typical for a deli; the space outfitted in diner kitsch. If there was a public outcry, I missed it since I was likely eating at Centre Street (sorry), which offered a closer rendition of the Montreal Deli my family preferred. Zeli's is not name-checked by Mr. Sax, although Centre Street, the now-Closed Caplansky's and the Pickle Barrel (which has undergone the worst conversion since Bob Dylan went Born-Again) do. 

And yet, ten years post Save the Deli, the family that owned Zelis has returned to the fray, at Yonge and St Clair of all places. 

For me, deli belongs to a category of food that I associate with childhood. It's tough to review on that basis since 1) anything I eat competes with my memories, and 2) my palate was different then. Was the Apollo 12"" hot dog at the Pickle Barrel really that good, or does it benefit from a slathering of nostalgia and the fact that I've eaten a much greater variety of stuff since I was a kid? That said, familiar flavours in comfy settings often lead me to give the benefit of the doubt over things I might raise: machine-slicing, for instance, which produces a thinner, more uniform cut (and can help out with a tougher cut of brisket since the fibres are cut shorter) but somehow makes for a less substantial sandwich if the meat is great. 

i visit over lunch hour. The place enjoys a steady stream of customers, plus a busy takeaway trade. A pair of meatniks work the aforementioned slicers almost constantly. 

I'm directed to seat myself and choose a booth towards the back. It's hot outside, and the air conditioning fights a losing battle, especially with the door swinging open constantly. 

My waitress is part of the original family. She provides some detail. She knows her stuff, and can speak to the different menu options, which are legion. 

Perhaps in response to some of the concerns raised in Sax's book, Zelden's tries to re-brand itself as ""the evolution of deli"". Smoked meats find their way into burgers and poutines and wontons and tacos and spaghetti, or are offset with avocados and Asian sauces. I'm sure they're good, but I eschew them in favour of an old school pastrami sandwich on rye bread, with French fries and cole slaw. A full sour pickle rides along. My dining companions order a brisket sandwich and a salad with turkey. 

The brisket is good. A normally dry cut is moist and meaty, filling the requested Kaiser nicely. The salad (normally a sad, dietetic affair at most delis) is a huge plate of greens and fresh veg. The turkey is smoked in house. It is also fresh and deeply flavoured. And there's lots. 

My sandwich is a solid fress. A good amount of nicely spicy meat on textbook Jewish rye. It's salty and fatty and just slightly chewy where perfect hand-slicing might have yielded that buttery meltiness that defines outstanding smoked meat. hot mustard improves things. French fries are clearly home-made. Skinny and fried amber-brown. They're served in a metal cup alongside my sandwich, which lots of restaurants do these days; it's artsy presentation in a place that should be devoid of artifice, and it allows the crunch to steam right out of my potatoes. Coleslaw is properly vinegary but mostly cabbage. My Proustian ideal for coleslaw involves more carrot, green onion and parsley, and a closer balance between sweet and sour. 

But these are minor quibbles. I want Zelden's to succeed, and provide an option for deli fans. I think about my kids and the places and tastes that they will remember, and I hope good smoked meat makes the list.

Let's start with the inside of my apartment. I have a 2 bedroom, 2 bathroom. The white crown molding, new paint, new doors, and new carpeting really make the place look nice on the inside. We have vaulted ceilings (we are on the 2nd floor), and everyone always comments on how nice our apartment is. The kitchen stove and all of the sinks and faucets are very outdated, and we have white counter tops which stain easy and are made of a cheap material. The wood cabinets are nice, and we have adequate cabinet space. The kitchen sink has a low faucet and is hard to wash anything bigger than a dinner plate or glass in. We do have a dishwasher, but it does not work well(there is no top wash), so we wash dishes by hand. They are slowly updating things, but I doubt the kitchen stoves will be updated anytime soon. Overall, the inside of the apartment is not bad at all.
 
The outside of the apartment complex looks nice, and the buildings are managed nice. The men who fix things are great here too. They do allow dogs here, we have two labs. They are great with pets, but no one seems to care about picking up dog poop. They say they have people come and clean up, but I haven't seen it. My dogs won't even go in the grass because of the amount of poo. I asked them to install a doggy bag station near the problem area, but they didn't seem too interested in that idea.
 
One more thing to be aware of, they DO NOT have 24 hour quiet time. Every night, people are screaming, kids throwing things, and dogs are barking. It is definitely not the place to live if you are a student(like me) that likes to study after work around 4:30-6:00. Our balcony is nice, but we seldom sit out on it for dinner because of the noise.
They advertise Sedona as a ""resort""...it is not that. About 50% of the apartment complex is 18-25 year olds that rev up their trucks and cars at all hours of the evening. The other half of the people are polite and quiet.

After being served water I began to look over the menu, I read a lot of the reviews on this site about the shawarma in a laffa and I had to say while it wasn't the best chicken shawarma I've had. It was still decent, what blew me away though was the other food being served in the restaurant as well as what my girlfriend got.

Taking a look around I noticed a lot of people getting the beef ribs which looked absolutely amazing. (Made me regret my choice of getting shawarma) My girlfriend got the chicken schnitzel which was fairly decent, average fries that are served at most restaurants around the GTA. The Chicken Schnitzel is served with a complete laffa, a salad (decent size), and as well as a side choice along with the schnitzel my girlfriend ended up bringing half of it home due to how much food she received.

In Phoenix, we were able to do ""famous"" BBQ and a stop at a ""trendy"" coffee shop, and then I said ""Okay, done! No more. Bye Phoenix!"" 

We spent 5 full hours at the USO because of the heat. 

This place is before the security line and you'll have to use the public bathroom before going in. They don't have their own. 

Five hours is a lot, but honestly this place was soooo great I didn't mind. They have everything!!! Lockers for your luggage, greeting cards, food, drinks, a cafe, a relaxation room with recliners (where I spent 95% of my time!), huge gaming room, library, internet cafe, and a baby room. EVERYTHING!!! 

This place was really busy, but it was so comfy I was still able to take a nap in the relaxation room. The relaxation room is darker than the rest of the USO. There's still a little light that filters in for safety though. It has a huge TV with DirecTV channels which I used to watch Captain America movies (how fitting!) and Friends. The recliners have sockets so you can charge your phone. 

There were a lot of food choices!!! Fresh baked dessert items (cookies, muffins, brownies!), microwavable dinners, turkey sandwiches and other kinds of sandwiches, yogurt.... MOVIE THEATER STYLE CANDY AND CHOCOLATE... AGAIN... EVERYTHING!

This place is really great. Definitely a great amenity for our military at a super busy international airport. Thanks hubby bubby!",315,8/10/2019 13:39,FALSE,0.081456587

Born in France, she decided to follow the call of God when she was 20 and she dedicated her life to the poor, women and children.
After meeting Paul de Chomedey de Maisonneuve, who was the governor of Montréal, she decided to migrate to Ville-Marie (that we now know as Montréal) in the Nouveau-Monde in 1653.
There she quickly became the angel of the infirms and the poor people and she had a crucial role in the education of many children.
She strongly believed that women were the key to the future of the country and worked very hard with Jeanne Mance, the administrator of the hospital, to make sure that all the women of various social classes in the colony could learn a job, preparing them for their new role of spouses and mothers and being a menthor and a trustworthy confidant and teacher for many children.
In 1655 she asked all the habitants of the colony to help her build a pilgrimage chapel, which was completed after 20 years in 1675.
Sainte Marguerite Bourgeoys was the founder of the Congrégation de Notre-Dame and until her death in 1700, she completely dedicated her life to the welfare of the people of Montréal.
She was canonized in 1982 and she now rests in the same place where she spent most of her life. This church is a beautiful tribute to her history and to the city of Montréal. 
 I felt moved and humbled at visiting such an important place, where many pilgrims from across the globe come every year to pay their respects and leave an ex-voto in the shape of a heart, symbolizing the generous heart of Sainte Marguerite Bourgeoys.",300,10/20/2016 4:47,FALSE,0.061040358

I was a bit nervous for my son who has only been receiving communion for 1 year now, by hand.  Luckily we weren't in the front and I was able to teach him how to receive the bread by his mouth.

I probably go there 25 -35 times a year - so paying $99 for a family membership is a great deal - other wise it's $5 per biker and $3 per runner per visit.  It's really an awesome place.

The term ""greenway"" here is used as meaning a ""nature preserve"", unlike the most of the greenways in Charlotte which are paths along creeks.  ASC Greenway is a 2300 acre privately owned nature preserve, owned by the Springs/Close family.  They made a fortune in textiles (we have some Springs towels in our house) but merged with a Brazilian compnay a few years ago and most, if not all, of their local mills are now closed.  As development was beginning to encroach the area, the family decided to leave this piece of earth to be undeveloped - and to also be used as education for nature and the environment.

The headquarters of the Leroy Springs & Company www.leroysprings.com is an old house dating back to the 1700s and was once occupied by the family.  It's the type of house that looks like it would be haunted and you'd see on Ghost Hunters.  The house sits at one of several entrances to the greenway.  This is the one near the ""dairy barn"".  Springs Farms used to sell milk, and this is where the cows were.  Though you can still see a few cows roaming in the field, the dairy barn has been converted and is now used for hosting events - including weddings.  There are also some horses, goats, donkeys, and mules near this entrance.

The greenway has many trails - all of which are open for walking, and some which are shared for horses and mountain bikes.  There are a few lakes, one with a nice one mile trail to walk around, campsites, animals, historic buildings, creeks, a small nature center, the original ""Nation Ford"" road which was a covered wagon trail, and a lot more.  There are often kids events, bird watching walks, and other events like their annual Earth Day celebration which is each April (the ASC Greenway opened on Earth Day so it's also their birthday).

Daily admission is a mere $3 for adults.  At most entrances, you put your cash or check in a pre-printed envelope and tear of the tab with numbers that match the envelope, and place said envelope in a drop box.  One of the entrances is also usually staffed.  The daily admission gets you unlimited access to the trails, but you must be a member to fish.  Also, the only entrance for bikes is behind the Leroy Springs Rec Center which is a little further into Fort Mill.

ASC Greenway is an absolutely beautiful nature preserve with a lot of history in it.  I'm glad it is very close to mi casa, and I never get tired of going there.  You can easily spend a day here hiking, biking, etc, so pack a picnic and go check it out.",481,4/15/2011 1:55,TRUE,1

But they don't tell you anything about a $25 fee to put the design on.

GbFiay7diwPiLMNdfNjWWg,hD2p1CFI7ZYjzjc2rVSRpA,_eVRTu6051uIYbr4n_y9zQ,2,8,0,5,"I went to their grand opening celebration on Sunday at 5pm with my mom. The place was packed. They were supposedly having a band play outside but because of rain, they were moved into a banquet room inside. Every table was filled with young families from outside of the retirement community. We were amazed at the number of people there. Obviously advertising in the local community made a difference. It seemed like this well known joint from East L.A. was not going to have any trouble getting business. 

At the restaurant, our group asked to be seated. We were told they weren't seating anyone, yet there were at least a hundred people already seated in the banquet room next door as well as at their restaurant and back room.  The waitress said we could come back in an hour at 6pm to get our name on a list to be seated at that time. It didn't make sense. Why were all of these outside families being seated, but our group from the retirement community being told to come back later?  We left and found another restaurant to eat at. 

A few days later on Wednesday, we came again at 5pm. We joined our group of friends that was already seated. The restaurant appeared to be either understaffed or not staffed with competent people. A ""flying club"" of about 30 people was meeting in the back room, and one waitress appeared to be dealing exclusively with them. The other waitress was handling all of the inside tables and outdoor patio tables. She was obviously overwhelmed. 

After waiting a period of time and no one giving us menus or drinks, my mom went to the bar to see if she could order from there. Tammy, the bartender was extremely busy. She was helping take drinks to the patio tables outside. One man from another group went to the bar to get his drinks and she yelled at him to not touch the drinks at the bar. Apparently he had been waiting for his drinks to arrive and thought he would just pick them up himself. After my mom witnessed that negative interaction, she decided to just grab menus and sit down. 

Our waitress finally made her way to our table to handout credit card transactions to others in our group who were leaving. She took our drink and food order at that time. We were told the restaurant was out of tacos and out of pork. They are known for their famous burritos with pork, but we were told they could serve them to is with shredded chicken instead. My mom opted for a taco salad with ground beef. I selected a bean and cheese burrito. 

.....crickets.....

The wait was painfully slow. No drinks arrived. My mom approached the bartender again. There were a lot of drinks waiting to be taken to people, but the waitress never did get them. The drinks had been sitting there for some time because the ice had melted in them. The bartender started bringing them to our table, but she wasn't sure whose drinks  they were. She put three watered down drinks in front of us. One was partially drank by someone and the other two may not have been margaritas. Hard to tell with the ice melted and orange wedges instead of lime at the rim of the glass. Obviously they were no longer margaritas ON THE ROCKS. She put another drink in front of my friend who said she didn't order the drink. The bartender then grabbed all of the watered down drinks and took them away. Fortunately, she made two fresh margaritas on the rocks for my mom and me, which was what we ordered and had been waiting for this entire time. They finally arrived at our table along with our food. 

The bus boy was nice enough to notice that we didn't have silverware or napkins. He brought us some right away so we could enjoy our food. The taco salad was really quite large with lots of goodies. There was a cup of jalapeños on the side, and a cup of habanero sauce on the side of my mom's salad and lots of guacamole inside. My bean and cheese burrito also had a side of habanero sauce, but no guacamole or sour cream. It was quite large too and tasted fine. 

The food and drinks were really not worth the wait or expense (our two margaritas, taco salad and burrito were about $33). Applebee's serves better tasting margaritas and they come with chips and salsa which wasn't the case here. The service on both occasions that I came to El Tepeyac was not up to par. I understand that new businesses will take some time to iron out the wrinkles, but this restaurant already had a loyal following from its California location. They really needed to bring their experienced wait staff with them to make the opening days at this location more of a success. We wish them well and hope the next time we come that they have their full menu available and competent wait staff to deliver it in a timely manner.",864,3/15/2018 14:39,TRUE,0.113102556

We couldn't get into La Carnita next door because of the ridiculous 2-hour wait, and DaiLo was packed - but by chance and kismet, LoPan (DaiLo's second floor tapas-style snack bar) had a table available, so following the orders of our hungry stomachs,  despite knowing nothing about the restaurant, we took a chance and had dinner here instead. We're so glad we did - sometimes, go with your gut. Stumbling upon even a random snack bar can bring you a satisfying, memorable meal.

First, the parking situation is decent. A block east of the restaurant are several small side streets where you can find free parking. If you can't find any, a decent amount of street parking around the restaurant is available. 

Second, the service. I just wanted to commend how wonderfully accommodating, professional, and friendly the staff were. They were aware of my shellfish allergy from the outset, and went out of their way to ensure that the Jellyfish Slaw salad wasn't ""shellfish"" and made sure I was able to eat it. 

Third, the food. Keep in mind that the orders here are all snack-size, appetizer-style, so don't expect a full-sized meal. We ordered: a) the Jellyflish Slaw, b) Truffle Fried Rice, c) Big Mac Bao (1 piece), d) Korean BBQ short ribs, e) KFC popcorn tofu. 

The Truffle Fried Rice and the Jellyfish Slaw were definitely the stand-outs - delicious flavours melding sweet and salty with the comforting feeling of chomping on fried rice, along with really interesting textures in the Jellyfish Slaw (it wasn't slimy, but super crunchy and delicious). I would pass on the Korean BBQ ribs (it's basically something you can make at home, and is really nothing special).

Overall, for portion size, the value isn't that great (I don't think $19 for the Truffle Fried Rice was warranted, given how small the portion was). But, regardless, the quality of the food is there, and it was a great meal.

I currently live in Portland, Maine.  Between these two places I discovered my love for the outdoors and the fact that Ohio is small potatoes when it comes to anything in the backcountry camping arena.

Cleveland, you gotta be tough... street smarts tough, not survive in the wilderness tough.

With that said, the Backpackers Shop is literally the only game in town. For this area this store in an anomaly and reminds me of many of the outfitting stores in more touristy area of the west and in northern Maine. Kayaking, hiking, camping, fly fishing, rock climbing... you name it, they got it.

The prices are insanely high and it caters to a clientele that wants to ""look"" as outdoorsy as possible.  Shopping online or going to an outlet would save you hundreds.  45$ for a winter hat? No, thanks. But, I am one of the lucky ones.  I can cruise over to Freeport, Maine and go to the flagship LL Bean store and then hit up North Face, Patagonia, and Horny Toad for all my outdoor apparel needs, at half the price.

The store is nice. Well laid out.  The exterior is also very pretty, abutting the metro parks.  You can bring your dog in on a leash and shop away.  They carry items that other places around here have no use for, so if you are in a bind before a long outdoorsy trip, this may be your spot. But, most likely you can wait until your destination and buy what you need from a place with many outdoors stores. Save yourself a lot of cash-o-la.",283,12/27/2016 13:40,TRUE,0.097528052

I was pleasantly surprised.  We had a reasonable price, they have an indoor pool, bar w/ restaurant and free breakfast daily, which includes cold cereal, scrambled eggs, sausage, make your own waffles, yogurt, fruit and drinks
Our room was nice.. the bathroom was a little small, but manageable.  Water pressure, temperature and bathroom amenities were all excellent.  In-Wall AC/Heating unit worked well and ran quietly.  You also get local TV w/ HBO and a coffee maker.  Our room also had a safe and mini-fridge.  Free WiFi acceptable with multiple locations to access throughout the hotel.
You can tell this place gets used heavily, but it's clean inside and out and the staff was very friendly and courteous.  
The challenges:  Difficult to find.  The entrance is a little confusing for the Rodi Rd. address - you actually enter on Maple Lane at the traffic light and go up the hill .  Follow the well placed Comfort Inn signs that lead the way.
Once there and checked in, they usually give you a map showing the layout of the hotel.  It will help you find your room, the layout can be a little confusing but once you get your bearings, you should be fine.
NOTE...  there is no elevator.  If a few steps are a problem, let them know when booking the room.  
Challenges aside, if you're a little budget-minded, this is an excellent alternative to staying downtown.  With light traffic, you're a 15 minute drive to everything the City of Pittsburgh has to offer and even a shorter drive to Monroeville.

Pad Thai with Chicken
Yum Neua Yang (BBQ beef salad) 
Stuffed Chicken Wings
Khow Pad with Scallop (Scallop Thai Fried Rice) 

For a group of 3 this was a little much in having both the fried rice and Pad Thai. The Pad Thai was easily devoured though since it had a nice sour zing and the noodles absorbed the flavour well. I wish the noodles were a little chewier though.

The BBQ Beef Salad reminded me of a Chinese dish. Here the salad had a nice sour zing similar to the Pad Thai but lacked a savoury taste inside the beef that I usually like.

The Stuffed Chicken Wings came exactly as advertised. I loved the work that went into the stuffing which is a mix of meat, herb, and rice noodle. This is definitely a great appetizer to order if you are in a sharing mood.

Last but not least we had the Scallop Fried Rice. This was an okay dish with scallop I found quite dry. I find it's rare to get chewy scallops in Asian restaurants so this is a simple carb dish you can order if you want to get stuffed or otherwise likely leave with leftovers if you have a small group like we did.",223,5/29/2015 19:06,TRUE,0.094129148

The special is half off a single pound of wings (normally $14 for a single pound) with the order of a drink (about $3 for a soda), every individual pound needs a drink in order for the deal to kick in. As a group of 4 we all got the single order of wings along with a soda. This deal sounded pretty good, however, all the drinks were flat and completely watered down, the Pepsi looked like ice tea. We had to send back the drinks because of how gross it was. If you're going for this deal you might as well order a beer

All the wings were fried and battered nicely. The wings themselves were portioned ok, they came with celery, carrot sticks and fries. In terms of flavours we ordered the Dry Cajun, Honey Jerk (Caribbean Jerk and Honey Garlic), Sweet Escape (Honey Garlic and Gar Par) as well as the Smokin Dill (Smokey BBQ and Dill).

HCpWV5uG8gJivLCL3JhiAQ,ORDnd5OZKDLNJ0Jr8cVPBw,_adbswq_0E8MoJ9eoVf6vw,1,2,0,0,"This about sums it up.... dirty, dusty, dank and musty... This was a reasonably priced hotel, but I think I'd skip it in favor of other options that are more convenient to town, and / or much less noisy.

Room: Just okay. We had a ""2 queen"" room on the 3rd floor, away from the lobby. There is NO elevator in this hotel, and the parking lot is VERY hilly - this made getting our luggage from the car to the room pretty treacherous. The room itself was just okay in size, and the walls paper thin... add to that a room door that was ""shaved"" way too high at the bottom (probably to accommodate plusher carpet at one time, but now just leaves an inch-wide gap), and don't plan on sleeping much. We heard the drunkards rolling in at 2 am, the early birds going to breakfast, kids running down the hall, cleaning carts rolling, you get the idea... if you're a light sleeper, avoid. Cleanliness was merely O-K.

Amenities: This is a ""no-frills"" place. In the room, you'll get a blow dryer, a television, and some soap. Some other notes:

1 - There is a ""free breakfast"", but the menu items don't change, and it's made with the minimum effort. I'd sooner have gone to a local diner - we forced the food down because it was there and convenient - not because it was edible. 

2 - The pool is an oddity, with a deep end that goes to 10 feet (who does that anymore, and why?!?!?) Also, depending on where you are in the hotel, expect to have to take a plane, a train, and an automobile to get to the pool... we had to walk down 2 VERY long hallways, go down 3 staircases, and walk down another long hallway just to get to it... is this the Comfort Inn exercise program? 

3 - Expect the outside entry doors to not take your card... it's a fact, and the hotel staff will tell you outright the key entries are old and don't work. If you go outside, plan to have to bang on the door to beg some other sap to let you in, or to have to go through the lobby.

4 - Parking is LIMITED... if you arrive any time past 5:00 pm ET (or come back from a day out), plan to have a really tough time finding a spot to park.

Sleep: Borderline poor. Note the details in the ""room"" section - I'm a light sleeper, and the noise was tough on me at points through the night.

Hotel Staff: Non-existent. The staff manning the desk was okay, not overly nice, not rude. They handed me our keys, and that was that. We never saw nor heard from them again.

Value: Poor, considering the location and the run-down state of the hotel. It was clean enough, yes, but bare bones, not up to modern standards by a long shot. Their rooms don't measure up to nearby competition... They either need to significantly lower their prices,or drastically improve the quality of the hotel and its rooms.",524,7/7/2014 19:51,FALSE,0.116411311

Do be aware that Richard and his guys are general contractors. If your project requires electricians, plumbers, or any other specialists, you will likely still have to contract with them yourself.

In December 2013 I bought a Marc Jacobs purse in the MJ Boutique located in Holt Renfrew in Yorkdale.  Just over a year after purchasing it, the clasp that attached the shoulder strap to the purse broke.  I returned to Holt's in Yorkdale to inquire as to how this could be rectified and was told that Holt's no longer carries Marc Jacobs.  Period, end of story.  I asked if they could provide guidance as to how to get the purse repaired since I did purchase it full price from Holts (and had the receipt for proof).  Basically, the sales person said so sad, too bad, nothing we can do to help you.

I was totally disappointed.  Regardless of whether they still carry the MJ line, I would have appreciated guidance as to how to get in touch with MJ, or alternately, a place locally to get the purse repaired.

I ended up googling MJ and contacted their customer service directly.  I had to send them a bunch of info, and they approved the repair.  Then I had to send the purse, at my cost for shipping which was $30. Not happy.  10-12 weeks for repair.  Really not happy with Holt's or MJ.

My friends and I came here during lunch hour on a weekday after attending court nearby. It was a bright and sunny afternoon but the inside of the restaurant was very dimmed and empty. We decided to give it a try anyways because we were craving wings, despite the fact that there's so many more delicious restaurants in North York. The service was extremely slow.. There were 2 waitresses working on the floor but neither one of them addressed our table. We waited an extremely long time just to place an order, and then to wait for our food, and finally to request for the bill. There was just nobody available to serve our table when the restaurant was empty. 

The food was meh, I mean I'm not really expecting much out of wings to begin with. The aggravating part was the drinks were really flat (when they're supposed to be carbonated), and were just slightly colder than room temperature, ew. 

Everything about this location just seems bleh. It's crazy to think this is a popular wings restaurant at an extremely busy location filled with amazing eateries and night life. I can't even say the service was terrible because it was non-existent. And I'm pretty sure nobody likes a flat coke/gingerale.

I found this salon with Aveda products in the area of where I'm visiting my family. I called ahead of time to schedule a hair appointment. I specifically said I wanted my hair washed, styled, and cut. The scheduler said that the services would be $80. When I got there the stylist, David, kept saying ""oh wow"" as if he'd never seen curly hair before and would be severely inconvenienced. He proceeded to tell me he cannot do styling (despite the fact that his title is ""master stylist."") He didn't do a very good job of washing my hair. After that, he blow dried it and lightly went through my hair with a flat iron. Then he tells me to stand up so he can cut my hair. I've never heard of a stylist telling a client to stand while cutting their hair. After that he thanks me and asked me if I liked my hair. I didn't even know what to say. I have never ever gone to a hair salon and not gotten my hair done! As in styled! I went to pay and the receptionist says the services were $80. I tell her $80 was the price given to me with a style.

The receptionist could sense I was upset so she offered to take $20 off the overpriced services (which didn't include what I was told over the phone.)

We discovered bright RED BLOOD on a pillowcase, flat and top sheet. Absolutely disgusting. It was abundantly clear that our sheets had not been changed since the previous guests. The blood had even soaked onto the mattress pad. 

When I went downstairs to alert the staff, we were not offered a new room, we were given new sheets to put on ourselves instead ... the sheets were for a full bed, not the king we had. We ended up sleeping on two flat sheets placed across the bed.

I have never been so angry in a public place. If I were not on a family vacation and if it had not been 10 p.m., I would have stormed out.

The next morning the bloody sheets that I had put into the hall were gone. I went down to discuss the incident further with the manager and found that the manager on duty had no knowledge of the events of the previous night. I pointed him to the photos that I was instructed to send the hotel's email. He reviewed and said that before doing anything he would need to see the issue in person - I reiterated that the bloody sheets were no longer on the bed, I had placed them in the hall and they had been picked up.

The staff is definitely a real strength at this place. Although it's clear that of the two staff, one is more of a cook, and the other is more for taking orders and serving, both seem to be able to help each other out in most areas.

Sure they have a good selection of shoes but I hate to feel like wanting to be treated respectfully is an imposition.

I went there Monday evening found a pair of expensive sandals I liked and tried to make  contact with a salesperson. No luck so I sat down.
Then a salesperson approached--and asked me to move!
I got up and started to walk out. Then, she said if I wanted shoes I needed to take a ticket!

I found their inability to set expectation and make some contact unprofessional and was put very far off when I was asked to move rather than a smile and ""we'll be right with you after I help this customer"" or some such. Only when I left did a salesperson shout after me. 
I bought a pair of shoes there several months ago and it was equally curt but efficient at least.

So yesterday I drove to The Shoebox in Black Earth where I was greeting QUICKLY by a very friendly salesperson who then spent a great deal of time with me.
I left with three pairs of shoes and spent $250.

The Shoebox has a huge selection but importantly the service was so far ahead of Morgan's that I have no doubt where I'll shop from now on.

1.) They stole my security deposit, a measly $200, and refuse to answer emails and calls regarding the issue, for over a month.  I paid in full for the entirety of my lease and left the space exactly as I found it.  I even offered to leave the key a month early, because I wanted to get out of the space. However, he refused to accept the key a month early and refused to release me from the lease, so I paid the final month in full.  I did return the key late (not 7 weeks late), because I moved out of state.  Monorchid never got in contact about the key, never reached out, or gave notice.  There is nothing in the lease about returning a key on a specific date.  The owner, Wayne Rainey, thinks he can just screw people over if they are a small business or they live out of state.  
2.) The Monorchid runs an unofficial commercial kitchen in the rear gallery.  There are no sprinklers back there in case of fire, there is no ventilation or range hood.  Is that safe? A weekly occurrence is visible smoke and grease odors wafting into other areas of the building.
3.) The internet connection is verrrry slow.  Sometimes it would slow to a crawl, which is unacceptable for a coworking space.  The private coworking WiFi password was commonly shared with non-members and during events.
4.) Although they claim to be a 24/7 coworking space, their main priority is as an event venue.  They host weddings every weekend and you would be hard pressed to try and get work done in full view of the wedding guests.  If you have to work on weekends, this space is not going to be a good fit.

If you are thinking of renting at the Monorchid, hosting a venue or even dropping by for the gallery, then you should know that you are supporting a serial misogynist, who gives zero f#*ks about stealing from you, much less treat you with a modicum of respect.

However, from the first step in, I felt a rush of nostalgia. The old fashioned style,  paired with the classic uniforms along with the wooden signs have the air of an ice cream parlor that's survived through a lot of different times and is still selling its classics.

The environment itself has great potential for a vibrant, ever youthful experience, but the lack of enthusiasm from the servers turned what could have been a glowing treasure that has persevered to a worn down, weary from the test of time ice cream parlor. Although the servers were pleasant, I still felt sort of uninvited, a stranger in a new place.

Looking past all of this,  the ice cream itself was delicious. I had the turtle delight sundae with cookie dough ice cream. The pinache and the hot fudge worked really well with the ice cream, and the combination really made me feel like I was getting a blast from the past, immersing myself in the nostalgia from my first impression.

Although there was a little too much whipped cream and hot fudge for the ice cream,  the ice cream itself was delicious. A rich creamy quality that did the job and left me satisfied on a hot summer day.

I will mention the one good thing first and then discuss the rest. So my child has been a patient for the last 11 months and did well after Dr. Bowne put in the PE tubes. Dr. Bowne has a great bedside manner so that I will definitely miss. The ones that did my kids allergy tests were very nice. HOWEVER....if I can't get in to see the ones I like, what's the point??? The schedulers and Dr. Bowne's medical assistant are AWFUL!!!!! The patient portal is useless! Voicemails are useless!!!! I have never seen such patient neglect. Literally, 5 minutes ago I got off the phone with the scheduler Azizah (or something weird like that) in which I cancelled all remaining appointments for my child and when I said I will not come back she said ""ok thank you"" and then hung up on me. So incredibly rude! I can't believe how little they care about who comes and goes and maintaining established relationships. 
Today is Wednesday and I left a patient portal message last Friday night regarding my son who needs his tonsils out. He has tonsillitis again and spiked another fever Friday of 104!!! No that is not a typo...104.8 was his highest and I almost took him to the ER. Same thing happened last month. I knew they were obviously closed until Monday BUT I did expect a reply of some sort Monday morning acknowledging the issue with an option to get an appointment. Dr. Bowne was in surgery Monday morning and no availability in the afternoon. There has been NO patient portal reply even as I am sitting here writing this review. I called and left two voicemails for Dr. Bowne's medical assistant Monday with no calls back even as of today. This office doesn't maintain a cancellation list to call patient's who need to get in so I called several times for updates. At 2:33pm, still on Monday, I called and this ""Azizah"" woman in scheduling told me I had just missed a 2:30pm cancellation. So while on the phone with her, I got to the office in 5 minutes and I was still told my son could not be seen even though I was in the parking lot. Then it got even worse....I asked to see another doctor in the office and I was denied because she said Dr. Bowne would have to give permission for another provider to see my son's records. This is total BS!!!!!!!! I have never heard of such a thing until Monday. She told me the PA was not available either.  She said she would send a message to her supervisor regarding getting my son in to be seen as well as sending a message to Dr. Bowne's medical assistant marked as an urgent matter and, yep you guessed it, no one has called me YET. So after this happened I wasn't going to sit around and do nothing so I got on my phone and found a doctor who would see him. I called who is now the NEW ENT office at 3:20pm and got a new patient 4pm appointment Monday. Now that is someone who CARES ABOUT THEIR PATIENTS!!!

When I moved in there was rust in the master bathroom I pointed it out to Sylvia and she told me it's was going to be taking care of well it was still there when I moved out! The microwave was so old it had yellow stains after I moved in I cleaned before I moved my belongings in I sprayed the microwave with bleach and 409 I couldn't believe the grease and grim that came off  the microwave not only that it was cracked up, I brought it to Alma attention and she stated to me as long as it's working she won't replace it. The oven stop working when I pulled the stove out it had paper, plastic tops, dead bugs when I called the office to report it I asked if they can have somebody to come fix the oven and clean under it? Alma stayed to me I had to wait until her cleaning people come out well if the cleaning people would have cleaned right it wouldn't have anything under it.... the whole apartment was raggedy the blinds was old and dirty that Alma wouldn't replace. The toilet seat was old and painted over, with me cleaning with bleach the paint wore off, instead of putting new toilet seats they painted them.... instead of corking around the bathtub they use paint. Only reason I stayed as long as I did because I was sick and not working because of a illness I have, I couldn't wait to get back to work so I can move. Other residents that had dogs would come where my apartment was and let they dogs go when the four apartments where my apartment was nobody had a dog and we had to put up with that the dogs would go on the rocks on the walk way just disgusting!!!!

I showed Alma all I did open the stove and refrigerator only thing she seen was a spot on the wall and stated she was going to spot paint, which she stated that was coming out my deposit and a spot on the carpet and that was all she found we sigh a paper that was all was coming out of my deposit. Alma mention spot painting when she clearly told me she told my sister in law they was out of that color that's when I knew the BS was on. She also mentioned to me the Ozone machine she asked did I smoke when I told her that 2 people I know which is former tenants when I told them about this said she didn't charge them because she didn't know they smoked she can smell cigarettes smoke in my apartment and not in there's that's some BS..... 2 days after I moved out she had all the appliances on the patio took up the floor carpet when I was told on numerous occasions that they wasn't remodeling the apartment I stayed in.

I called they corporate office numerous occasions and never received a call back from corporate office but received a call from Alma and she stated that the back charges from the water,trash and garbage was from 2016 when I first moved in if so why was I billed all the way back from May 1st to May 30th, June1st to June 30th when I clearly didn't move in until June 30th 2016 she just charging me a whole lot of BS to eat up my deposit.

Like most people, I'll sometimes feel like there are knots in my neck or shoulders.

Michelle is that person! She seems to know exactly how much pressure to apply and how the muscles in your body connect.

Any complaints I've had: a stiff neck from sleeping wrong, a tight feeling in my hip- Michelle knows just what to do to work it out.

They've recently remodeled the entire facility, making it one of, if not the most, premier spots to grab a brew, haircut, and shave. A typical appointment starts by being greeted as you walk in and offer a complimentary drink (beer, water, coffee, etc. - I usually go for the beer lol). Kim then calls me over and we start with the cut. For awhile, I'd get a one on the sides and a few inches of length on top with a straight razor hard line. Now, I've mixed it up a bit and get a short fade on the sides (starting at zero) and three-to-four inches on top styled front-to-back. Kim is incredibly experienced and has the ability to diversify her craft and make me look great, regardless of hair style. She concludes the cut with a warm towel over the face, wash with shampoo and conditioner, a neck shave with a straight razor, and massage. Every month or so I'll even request nose hair removal, which is painless and leaves you breathing easier haha! Swagger does everything right, starting with service, and that matters to me.

I shop at this Yorkdale location once in a while when i see what i like. Usually not a great selection of shoes for men. 
But most importantly today, i had the most degrading experience from a sales rep/sale manager/loss control  :  Name Carlos.
I decided to go shopping with my family for mother's day celebration and tried on some shoe in the men's section, and after couple of tries, i found one that i liked. The lady that attended to me was really nice and pleasant. She promptly got my size from the back and we headed for cashing out. But as soon as Mr. Carlos saw me at the till, he came immediately to stand by the cash register to monitor the transaction, and once i paid with my debit card he left almost right away . So my question  for Holt Renfrew is this : do you always need a manager to stand by cashier when cashing out customers or did he decided to come and  monitor the transaction because I am black!!!  Is this your standard practice when it come to people of color or  Mr Carlos was just doing his job as a racist person. 1 really want some answers. 
After the sale, i confronted Mr. Carlos and ask him why he had to come monitor my transaction even though there were so many other transaction going on. He denied the accusation and lied that he was just there to get sales, even though the sale had been secured by the female rep.  My question again is that will he stand by the cash register to monitor all transaction , or just the black customers!!!  This looks like racism and discrimination to me to me and Carlos exhibited poor judgement.

OK, I've seen  way more than my share of brewpubs...  So far, I've only partaken of their beer, but they also serve sandwiches and bar snacks that I'm looking forward to trying soon. 

With all of the brewing establishments in Dane County, you might be asking why you should trek over to Westport for a beer.  There are a lot of good reasons to come over to Parched Eagle.  First and foremost, the beer.  Their flagship IPA, Hop Bearer, is fantastic.  I rank it up there with the best of them, Ballast Point, Fantasy Factory, Ale Asylum's Ballistic, Green Flash, Three Floyds, and Toppling Goliath.  Crane Ale APA is also very good (I'm enjoying one from a growler at home while I type this review), and the American Strong Ale they served for Craft Beer Week was a treat.  I'm super stoked for the Imperial IPA next weekend.  

The people at Parched Eagle make it a lot of fun to pop in for a pint.  Jim, the proprietor and brewmaster, is a great host, as are all of the folks I've met working at his establishment.  

Located in a vanilla mixed use (businesses on the bottom, apartments on top)strip center, you'll be pleasantly surprised when you walk in.  Right up front is a beautiful bar: its base is made out of - get this - antique pianos - and the top is natural hardwood (think a tree that's polished).  There's plenty of seating at and around the bar, a large room to the side that's great for a larger group, and has a couch with a coffee table and games, and a brand new patio with several 4-tops with umbrellas - really nice.  The brewhouse is right behind clear plexiglass so you have a great view of where the magic happens.  

If Westport still seems like an out of the way spot, let me share some stats with you.  It's roughly 15 minutes from Middleton via Route M, and around 20 from downtown - not as long as you might think and I promise it's worth the trip!",363,7/11/2015 2:45,TRUE,0.100691556

My wife had the ribs with mashed potatoes that also sat under a heat lamp for awhile. She also added the kapow shrimp which tasted pretty good. For an extra $5 you could get this in an all you can eat side.

Having lived in Dubai all my life, I grew up fond of this kind of food, Mandi, Mathbi, Madfoon, Bukhari, etc. Yemeni and Saudi food in Dubai was and still is very popular and is known for delicious taste, huge portions, and very reasonable (sometimes even cheap) prices. 
We were referred to this restaurant by a family member. Not sure how she found out about it bcz she never tried it so far but we, my husband and I, decided to give it a shot and head there. We arrived at around 12:45pm. We expected to find some people when we walked in but it was empty. Not a problem. The first thing that I would say is probably the only major negative in this place is the smell. My husband was about to take me some where else bcz I was getting uncomfortable. As you walk in, you are hit with a strong smell of cleaning chemicals that do not smell good at all. I am not sure what the reason is but I decided to just ignore the smell and order and go in as soon as possible bcz the smell was mostly only at the entrance. 
I ordered the goat mandi and my husband ordered the lamb with rice dish. We were asked to pick a seat either on the table or in the traditional Arabic section and they would bring out the food. We also were offered to get our drinks from the fridge. 
We decided to sit in the Arabic Jalsa area since there was no one there. The food came out in a reasonable time - about 10 min and it looked great. The meat was in the center of the dish with some browned onions on top, both dishes looked very inviting. The food was served with a lime wedge, some cucumber yogurt and a green chili sauce on the side. We dug in and the food was delicious! I was so glad at that point that my husband did not insist on making us leave and that I was able to survive the entrance and try this good food. The meat was delicious and very tender and the rice was cooked to perfection. Portion size as always in these restaurants was just right. Having not had breakfast, I finished my dish and of course my husband did too. 
After eating this great meal we left feeling drowsy lool, a typical feeling after you have such a good big rice meal  
We paid at the entrance just before we left and the price was $39 for 2 dishes and 2 drinks. Slightly on the expensive side but not too bad. 
I hope they will find a solution for the smell in this place because the food and the service are so good, it would be a shame if ppl decide not to come in because of that.",503,9/20/2016 21:21,TRUE,0.119551531

Unlike what other reviewers say, parking is rarely ample: the lot is also used by the busy medical complex that the restaurant is located in during the day and with another restaurant or two in same at night. Since this place opened, parking spaces have been few and far between and the driving in the lot is atrocious.

Like other restaurants in the area, it's loud inside, serving as yet another place where people bump into other people they know, intentionally and otherwise, and then burst into incomprehensibly loud chatter.

Back to the restaurant review now that I've had my rant. Service is pretty bad, I've had to ask for drinks to be delivered multiple times, including one occurrence of one diner receiving their drink and the other ignored. Don't dare tell the server that you need another minute to think about what you're going to order or your table will be deserted.

The food has improved since its opening, I found a number of fellow diners (and myself) were served food that tasted as though it was not seasoned in the kitchen. While food I've had at Ba-Li Laffa since has been better, inconsistency is to be expected.

Appetizer dips, while quite good and definitely taste right, are served with what appear to be what would otherwise be rejected laffas, too thin and usually overcooked. These are not the laffas you're looking for. Salads are exactly as advertised in the menu, no more and no less.

Sandwiches are served in the right laffas, but could be tastier / condiments in them could be more plentiful/better. Requests for the addition of spicy sauce in the sandwiches are frequently ignored (or the sauce is useless). Mains are average.

I haven't experienced the take-out, but it can be rather busy and fills the middle of the restaurant with even more loud people.

Eden has a great selection of Korean and Asian snacks and prepared foods as well as a huge range of ramen noodles.

While it can be hard to attract someone's attention for help during busy times, the salespeople are very knowledgable and attentive once they get to you.

The salespeople are not pushy--I have not felt bad about walking out after trying on several pairs of shoes like I have at some other stores. 

The only downside is that most of the brands they carry are very expensive.

When I applied for a apartment there I had to pay a large deposit because of my credit it's funny to because they never showed up on my credit for doing a inquiry. When I moved in there was rust in the master bathroom I pointed it out to Sylvia and she told me it's was going to be taking care of well it was still there when I moved out! The microwave was so old it had yellow stains after I moved in I cleaned before I moved my belongings in I sprayed the microwave with bleach and 409 I couldn't believe the grease and grim that came off  the microwave not only that it was cracked up, I brought it to Alma attention and she stated to me as long as it's working she won't replace it. The oven stop working when I pulled the stove out it had paper, plastic tops, dead bugs when I called the office to report it I asked if they can have somebody to come fix the oven and clean under it? Alma stayed to me I had to wait until her cleaning people come out well if the cleaning people would have cleaned right it wouldn't have anything under it.... the whole apartment was raggedy the blinds was old and dirty that Alma wouldn't replace. The toilet seat was old and painted over, with me cleaning with bleach the paint wore off, instead of putting new toilet seats they painted them.... instead of corking around the bathtub they use paint. Only reason I stayed as long as I did because I was sick and not working because of a illness I have, I couldn't wait to get back to work so I can move. Other residents that had dogs would come where my apartment was and let they dogs go when the four apartments where my apartment was nobody had a dog and we had to put up with that the dogs would go on the rocks on the walk way just disgusting!!!! I moved out July of this year I moved out early so I can get my belongings out and to clean the apartment which Alma told me I didn't have to but I figured she was up to something and how right was I. Upon me turning in my 30 day notice Ciara that work in the front office inform me that they do a 8 day walk through and I stated to her why would they when they're remodeling the apartments as people move out and she stated to me they're not remodeling the apartment if it's in good shape and when we did the walk through with Alma I brought up the remodeling to Alma and she stated to me they was only remodeling the apartments that need it and mines was in good shape they won't be remodeling my apartment. After I moved out Alma and I did a final walk through and she couldn't find anything wrong with the apartment because I cleaned the apartment from top to bottom I mean Literally I cleaned ceiling fans to base boards,appliances I paid somebody to clean the stove and refrigerator pulled out. I showed Alma all I did open the stove and refrigerator only thing she seen was a spot on the wall and stated she was going to spot paint, which she stated that was coming out my deposit and a spot on the carpet and that was all she found we sigh a paper that was all was coming out of my deposit. Alma mention spot painting when she clearly told me she told my sister in law they was out of that color that's when I knew the BS was on. She also mentioned to me the Ozone machine she asked did I smoke when I told her that 2 people I know which is former tenants when I told them about this said she didn't charge them because she didn't know they smoked she can smell cigarettes smoke in my apartment and not in there's that's some BS..... 2 days after I moved out she had all the appliances on the patio took up the floor carpet when I was told on numerous occasions that they wasn't remodeling the apartment I stayed in. Received a email a week later that I was getting $872.79 back of my $1295 deposit some bogus charges they charged me back bill for water,garbage,trash and bug noted all the way back from May 2019 and was charged more than it was when I stayed. I called they corporate office numerous occasions and never received a call back from corporate office but received a call from Alma and she stated that the back charges from the water,trash and garbage was from 2016 when I first moved in if so why was I billed all the way back from May 1st to May 30th, June1st to June 30th when I clearly didn't move in until June 30th 2016 she just charging me a whole lot of BS to eat up my deposit. When I brought up about her telling me that she wasn't remodeling the apartment Alma stayed to me that was a last minute decision some of her lies 2 days after moving out the apartment was stripped of everything down to the flooring and carpet she also had the nerve to tell me that she still had to put the ozone machine in after painting the walls the cabinets in both bathrooms and in the kitchen using all kind of chemicals from putting the flooring and carpet you can still smell smoke some more lies to keep my the rest of my deposit.I",977,8/26/2019 0:50,FALSE,0.0956327

Bacon was acceptable. 
Coffee was good, and refilled promptly. 
Choc shake was I think made chocolate with syrup (don't quote me on this), but it was served with one of those great tins that holds everything that won't fit in the glass, which made up for it.

1.  Throughout the afternoon and evening, staff members hung out right outside the front door smoking cigarettes and clustering the entrance way.

2.  The coffee was watered down that was offered in the lobby and breakfast.

3.  The breakfast has typical offerings:  coffee, juice, yogurt, fruit, grits, oatmeal and muffins, but the hot food (eggs and sausage) were very, very dry.

4.  The pull out bed in the suite was not even a notch better than the floor.  You could feel the frame, the mattress was so thin and the comforter was more like foam than a comforter.

5.  The structure of the building and hallways were tight and confusing.

We shared a bowel of the Brunswick stew & both got the combo platters so we could have a sampling of the different meats/sides. The stew was very good, sweet but very layered in flavor and hearty. The dinner platters were very large, not lacking in size at all. The meats were very good as were the sides. Our complaint was that the meat on both plates were barely warm, the pulled pork was room temp (bordering being cold), yet the sides were piping hot. We had the bacon mac & cheese- very cheesy and good. The fries- good seasoned with rosemary, huge amount, the baked beans- good tasting, but a little on the dry side and the slaw- this  was a let down, definitely tasted like GFS coleslaw, which I like but not when I'm going to a BBQ joint. When the server finally came over ( only girl working the room that night...being saturday)to check on us we had already eaten half our food but did mention that while everything tasted good the meat was next to cold.

Now, you would think the owner who kept popping out of the kitchen onto the floor would come over and address that issue...an apology, a free dessert perhaps....nope, nothing.

Check in was fast but we did do advanced purchase, prepaid. They only hold $50 on your crédit card. 

Lobby looks odd with all those couches, their not all the same colour and just looks like they picked what ever and placed them there, feels cluttered. Could use a makeover. 

Walked around the hotel, the hallways off the lobby and it almost feels like a ghost hotel. Not much action. 

I did not see a business centre with computer access. But they do have free wifi. 

Not sure what the deal with Udrive, the worker in the booth was just on his cell phone. Not very professional. 

Never used the restaurant as we just bought food from the grocery store. 

Pool, well what can i say about that... Not much. The big pool was freezing cold so couldnt use it with my 13 month old so we had to stay in the ""hot tub"" which was bath water température (perfect for my son). 
Fitness room is in with the pool, but only adults are only allowed in. 
You can't take pool towels out of the pool area so best if you have little children, bring their own towel so you can wrap them up while you walk back to your room. 

4th floor ice machine was not working, had to go to 8th floor if we wanted ice. 
Fourth floor hallway was clean for the most part. 

Was on the fourth floor which was near to the elevator but never heard the elevator except for rowdy kids at 2am, which all i can say is good thing they did not wake up my kid or they would have gotten an unpleasant speech. 

And if you are on the street side, yes you hear the traffic which the front desk does not mention, just that it faces the city. Which is a nice view of the calgary tower/downtown. But if you are a light sleeper, ask for other side. 

Beds were okay comfortable, but i had to untuck the sheets to pull them high up over my to keep warm as it got cold with the AC at some points in the night. 
The pull out sofa, not as comfy but thats a Given on what type or bed it is.

Then the family in front of us ordered, but did not pay.  No card, no money left their hand.  What?  So like you are giving out free ice cream and making us wait in line?

Seriously?!  So I finally get my answer and order it.  My husband also ordered a blizzard.  He ordered a Turtle Pecan blizzard and received some random peanuts in his blizzard.

You'll pay $50 bucks for an individual membership but still pay $5 bucks or more to park for special events and additional fees for using some of the facilities. There is additional charge for the kayaks & canoes.

There are multiple entrances depending on the activity you're interested in. If you are going to walk or hike, you need to be aware that you may be sharing the trail with mountain bikers.

If you're not a member, you'll pay $5 per visit.

There are several elements of this place that I think make it appealing.

They do have several lakes that are open to fishing for members only.
They provide kayaks and canoes for rentals.

They don't have any paved biking trails but many mountain bike trails.

They also have Canteen Music sessions on select Fridays where you can sit outside, listen to some local live music and enjoy adult beverages.

Delightful decor, creamy harvest walls and very simple and elegant Tai artworks.  Each table was decked out with white tablecloths and every chair had covers with bows; it was an extremely welcoming ambience. 
 
Traditional Tai music played faintly in the background as we were seated and our orders were taken right away.  We ordered the Pineapple Curry with beef, coconut rice for 2 and the calamari as a warm up.  I also indulged in a Tai cold coffee.  The Pineapple Curry is a wonderful blend of coconut curry, beef, red and green pepper, pineapple and lemon grass.  

The food took its time and I don't know what it is about this place but acoustically I could hear every other person's conversations at our table.  This was slightly annoying but the calamari came right on time to distract me from this dilemna.

The calamari was nice and crispy, not greasy, wide oval slices accompanied by a sweet and sour sauce.  The curry was a decent portion and could easily feed two persons and the coconut rice was so pungent we could smell it before it came to the table.  Even at a mild curry rating, it still had punch, but then again I love hot spicy food.

Service : 3/5
Friendly enough service.  We visited during around early dinner 18:00 EST.  Only 1 other couple was in the dining area.

Food : 3/5
My wife opted for the the Halibut and Chips and Haddock and Chips for myself.  A bit more pricey than our go to spot at Painted Post Fish and Chips.  

We received our orders in about 10-15 minutes, as for the dishes themselves, the fries were done extra crispy just the way we like without us requesting to be cooked as such.  As for the ""fish"" both the haddock and the halibut were tender and fresh not mushy or soggy.  Each of us received 1 decently sized piece of fish for our orders.  Batter wise I'd have to say it was light and crispy, less greasy than we have tried at other fish n chip spots.  I'd rate the oiliness at 3/5** (view rating list below).  For the price paid, would have been nice to have a bit more fries included with the order (we love our fries when they aren't frozen!)

Condiments :
Ketchup in a squeeze bottle, not sure on the brand or quality.  They have something that resembles tartar sauce, but it had a pink/orange tinge to it, which was also in squeeze bottle.  However, something in the tartar sauce was making my tongue tingle to almost a numbing sensation, I had consumed more of their tartar sauce than my wife, so she didn't notice a similar sensation on her tongue.  Since I have no idea what was/is the cause of that odd tingly/numbing sensation, I would caution other foodies with sensitive tongues to go easy on the custom tartar sauce that is provided to customers.  Take out packs of tartar sauce are available (not as flavorful, but likely without that tingly/numbing aspect), along with malt vinegar packets are available.

Beverages : 
We are kinda picky on our Water, not fond of tap water at all due to varying mineral content and sodium content, we usually bring our own from Home, since we buy 15L Ice River water and fill up reusable bottles.

Alternatively we opt to share a can of soda or Iced Tea.  Not many places offer filtered water as an option.  Also, not all bottled water is good quality.  At this venue they charge $1.00 + HST for a small glass of ice water with a 2 slices of lemon.

Other :
Parking is rather limited in the little strip.  However, there is additional parking in the adjacent plaza within walking distance.  Debit/cash accepted.  Hard to enter the parking lot if you are heading Southbound on McCowan, other drivers will likely not give way for you to turn in.  I had other drivers blasting their horns at me as I was waiting for a gap in the traffic flow.

Repeat visit ?
Possibly yes, a fellow friend on Yelp, had reviewed made in house fresh onion rings.  So may return to try the fresh onion rings.


Oiliness rating** :
1/5 very light and no oily after effect on tongue
2/5 still relatively light, Malt Vinegar/Lemon wedges not yet needed except by choice
3/5 medium level of oiliness; light effect on the tongue ; Malt Vinegar/Lemon wedges may be used to cut grease
4/5 starting to lean towards being heavy; greasiness now needing Malt Vinegar/Lemon Wedges to cut grease

They rescheduled my appointment with Ashley. I didn't realize she is the owner until I arrived there. 

Two weeks ago at my appointment, I arrived 15 mins early. Their massage therapist Jason offered 15 mins complimentary chair massage while I waited. I really liked the blue oil scent he used and I was very relaxed. He showed me the massage area and I liked the way he decorated his room, mix of east and west.

So back to Ashley, I requested my color to be one shade lighter and she nailed it! Two weeks later, I am still receiving compliment from my friends and even from strangers! 

I also tried botanical hair treatment while I was there. I highly recommend this hair treatment. My hair was already healthy and shiny. After the hair treatment, my hair became so soft and more healthy looking. My hair was never this soft before. Hair coloring, hair dryer... damages hair but botanical hair treatment is your solution.

This really threw me for a loop the first time I stopped by a Papa Murphy's but when you get it home and bake it right, you're getting an extremely fresh pizza for a great price.

They assemble the doughy pizzas right in front of you and wrap them up. The staff here is very friendly and will make sure you know exactly how to bake the pizza. The instructions come with the directions for all of their styles so it's nice for them to make sure you're not baking a thin pizza with deep dish instructions.

My favorite is the thin crust. So crispy, almost like flatbread. The sauce is light and fresh, a bit peppery than most which I appreciate. The pepperonis get slightly crunchy on the edges if you bake it right and I love it.

Along with pizza, they also do cheese breads, salads, cookies, and cinnamon desserts. They have Pepsi products so keep that in mind if you're a Coke addict like me.

Check out their website for all kinds of different specials, offers, and coupons. They currently have a Yelp offer as well! I believe if you order online they also have a discount. Family size pies are $10 on Tuesdays. For as fresh of a product as your getting, the deals are a win-win.

Let's get this out of the way first.  I rarely eat at places like Kelsey's, Jack Astors, Casey's, etc.  The only reason we were here was I had a gift card I received from work.  I'm not a big fan of chains honestly to begin with.  

This Kelsey's location is pretty spacious.  It's the perfect place for a family after seeing a movie at the Cineplex next door.  Walking in, we're immediately greeted by a friendly hostess.  When you come to a place like this, expect friendly service with a smile.  It's in the manual of all these types of places.  As long as you're not being a jerk, you'll have a pleasant experience service wise.  

We ordered the fish and chips, chicken apple pecan salad, and a kids meal for our little one which was a pasta dish.  Food doesn't take too long to come out but it wasn't terribly busy when we were there.  

Fish and chips:  I wasn't too impressed with this one.  The batter on the fish was way too crunchy/hard and the fish itself was very mushy.  My work place cafeteria is not the best by far, but even they made a better fish and chips.  The fries were OK, but could not save the dish.

chicken apple pecan salad:  This one according to my GF was much better. There's a lot of variety in the salad which works for and against it.  You get a bunch of different tastes, but not enough of the actual greens because they have so much items to put in. The breaded chicken pieces were pretty good though.

Kid meal:  The fact that my little one took 2-3 bites of the pasta and didn't want anymore said it all.  She usually loves pasta.  I took a bite myself and knew why.  Pasta was way overdone, and barely any sauce.  No taste at all.  The salad that came with pasta was good. 

I want to like this place better because of the great service.  Our meal just wasn't up to par unfortuantely.",357,5/27/2016 12:30,TRUE,0.107731453

She came in and dropped off her stuff, then went back outside and brought in a drink of some sort for another person who seem to have an appointment with her at the same time. While she was chatting with this other person, she had two or three of the staff almost yelling at her and pointing at me explaining that I was a client and I have been waiting for quite a while. She looked very confused and sort of ignored me for a little while longer. Then she decided to check her phone, and finally came to sit with me.

She had no idea about the artwork descriptions or examples I had given online, nor did she seem very interested in what I had to say. She kept looking at the other client.

The place was full, surprising for a lazy Sunday evening in North York, and there seemed to be a good mix of families, students, Asians and non-Asians alike. 

Whenever I try a new Viet place out, I normally order the pho special, and this time was no exception. I was really surprised at the broth - very light and clear - and there was a generous helping of perfectly cooked thin noodles. Also, unlike some other pho shops, you could tell there were different cuts of beef, from the brisket to the thinly cut rare beef. A little more tripe would be good, though I can understand, especially in this neighbourhood, that they pulled back on some more risqué (for the western palate) elements.

Also in our order was the rice special (R1) and the vermicelli special (V1). The rice special had two types of grilled meat (pork chop and chicken) which were flavoured well, and beef that was sautéed with onions. The beef and chicken were perfectly cooked and delicious, while the pork was a teeny bit dry. There was a perfect mound of rice, topped off with a fried egg - would have been better if the yolk more runny, but there was enough to mix in with the rice that I took (about 1/5th). The pickled veggies weren't pickled enough; I'm not sure if they weren't holding the vinegar because they were grated instead of thick julienne chopped, or if they just needed a longer soak.

The vermicelli dish came with an awesome spring roll, along with three meats, too: Viet sausage, pork, and shrimp. The shrimp - minced and formed into a ball and wrapped around a sugar cane stalk - was great, but the sugar cane was flavourless like it had been sitting in too much water... The pork was thinly sliced and was good, but the surprising thing was the Viet sausage. Unlike the normal small links normally served, they had formed the meat into rectangles so the pan-fried blocks resembled spam or luncheon meat.

I work in the area, so am only here during lunch hours.  Having said that, the food isn't spectacular.  I come here sober, during daylight hours, sans food beer-goggles.  So my rating is based on comparing Vesta with its surround places around Bathurst, and it falls short.

I tried it out a couple of weeks ago.  Although the menu has primarily Greek items, I opted for the Fish & Chips, which only came with one piece of fish.  The fries were nothing special.  It also came with a serving of salad.  The tartar sauce is given in packet form.

They do have a solid male-only following during the day.  These regulars seem to be in no hurry when dining here.

It was nice to have a true general contractor that could handle all aspects of the work (including locating and removing mold, thanks to a fridge leak). 

Overall, Richard and his team did amazing work and the finished product speaks for itself.  No question -- we would (and likely will for a bathroom remodel...) hire Xtreme Interiors again.",244,6/16/2018 5:27,FALSE,0.119951675

Part of this plan was to find various trails, parks, greenways and get more familiar with them to appreciate where I live. One of those outings was to this gem. 

Anne Springs Close Greenway, like others have noted, is just a short car ride south of Charlotte in South Carolina. If you are a resident of South Carolina, I think you can get a membership or get in for free. If you aren't, like me, bring some cash and pay the entry fee. 

Bring a picnic and take your time strolling the trail. You'll pass by some old homesteads, one of which belonged to Billy Graham's grandfather. This was an ideal spot to take my mom and mother-in-law. They loved it! You can also bring your pup, but make sure you bring doggie bags to clean up behind him. 

It's an ideal location to take your family portraits; it is picturesque with open fields, wooden cabins, or fields of horses. When my husband and I were there we saw many families posing and getting great rustic shots and I'm sure their holiday cards look picture perfect. 

There is also a barn that can be rented out for weddings, receptions, or other events. The outside is super cute, but the inside is basic. I'm sure it's that way to allow people to decorate it for any occasion.",242,12/29/2014 0:22,TRUE,0.098766003

Let's start with the 3.5 hour set up. I had a compatible modem that worked with spectrum. The tech could not get it to work(hmm.) so I had to go with their modem that charges a monthly fee. But was told if I got my own I could send theirs back and have the 10$ fee prorated and send it back via  ups. Well I know shit does not work like that unless you have tight customer service and billing systems that work properly. I have work in IT and completely understand  how this shit works.

SO I purchase another modem that is compatible with WOW set it up and call their customer service to have the MAC  address enabled and ask for a rlbox to send their modem back. WOW advises me I can use the box it came in and go to a UPS STORE AND return it free. Hmm. You see how this is going.  I do so and return it.  3 days later my internet service is not working and I isolated it to the modem. I call WOW Land their tech support tells me they are having a major system issue and they can not log my ticket and that I need to schedule a visit  for a tech because  my service is broken, how ever he can not note my account because of their system issue and I should call back. I know this is BS because a company with any integrity would make a paper copy and enter it into the system. The next day I call back to schedule my appointment and a tech tells me to wait a minute and asks for My MAC again and my service mysteriously start to wok again. WOW amazing. LET'S skip 45 days and I receive a bill for 135$ for internet that should cost 39.99 a month. 25$ for returning the modem, 10 $ x 2 month for renting their modem, 10 late fee for not paying my bill in advance. So I call customer support and after an hour I have the fees removed, it was an interigation from someone who for sure does not speak English as a 1st language. After all that I ask to pay my bill. The rep then tells me that I have to use an automated system unless I want to pay 5$ for her to process it. I ask well will your IVR system know you have made adjustments to my account, she of course lets me know of course. I let her know I understand how billing systems work and do not believe her. She assures me this is not the case. So she put me into the IVR system and low and behold I the account credits are not honored. I call back an have to deal with the same shit for another 30 minute while not being assured that the modem rental fee has been remove even though I was charged 25$ for returning by UPS. Yeah this is a company that provides shit service.

The fix was only meant to be a temporary move to get me looking presentable for being in apublic venue. Another dye job was promised to get my hair back to my blond color, that Ashley unprofessionally spent the while time telling me was out of fashion and dated. My hair is still damaged from this nightmare salon.

Quite possibly one of the worst long experiences of my life went in for Baliage tohelp even out an all over color ended up leaving looking like a striped skunk with red and black stripes in my hair which were not the colors that I asked for my hair was cut very unevenly unprofessionally I later found out that the Stylist with was an apprentice an had no experience in Baliage. had I known I would never have let her touch my hair. She had the front desk girl mixing dyes for her which I'm certain she was not trained to do so. I came back for a second time and the stylist promised she could fix my hair and again my hair looks worse it was actually darker and none of the lighter blonde which I wanted and ended up close to being a brown color I finally complained and asked for another stylist the other stylist was able to get my hair to the point where it was presentable enough to go in public again but was not able to return me to my original blonde because of all the black and red that the first Stylist put my hair I was told I would need to come back another time to get my hair back to blonde. I finally asked to have the owner fix my hair and made an appointment when I came in to see the owner to get my hair back to the original blonde from the brown and weird colors that were in it she told me that she was going to charge me to fix their mistakes so now I have hair that is not the color that I wanted when I came in, it's damaged from the over processing, and uneven haircut.

She's considered the 'mother of the colony', the colony being Ville-Marie, the future Montreal. Called to teach, she helped educate children and provide aid to the poor. On the site of the current chapel (from 1771) lies the remains of the original stone structure Marguerite would have known.

The actual chapel is far humbler than the grand basillicas found elsewhere in Montreal. Walking through the museum, however, you'll learn quite a bit about Marguerite Bourgeoys. In fact, one room is dedicated to explaining her life through...scenes in a dollhouse. These dolls were made by sisters in the late 20th century and can be considered Madame Alexander meets Madame Bourgeoys.

The best attraction by far in the museum is the staircase that leads to the top of the chapel. You'll have amazing views of Vieux Montreal from the top. There stairs are fairly steep so take your time.

The view alone adds an extra star to this review.

Everybody has their own view as to what BBQ should be, and in my opinion, Smoke offers a very tasty northern style BBQ. Good smokey flavor, nice rub, and a slightly sweet and tangy sauce. 

As part of my career, I have traveled all around America, and one of my hobbies is trying BBQ while traveling, so I consider myself an non official expert amateur BBQ sampler. Smoke BBQ ranks in my personal top 10. 

We live close to this restaurant, and have eaten there at least once a month for the last 2 years. Obviously I like the BBQ at this joint, but what makes a restaurant good is the consistency of the food,  of the service, value, and of the cleanliness. Smoke BBQ is consistently good in all of those categories. 

The menu features a variety of Smoked BBQ meats, ribs, riblets, brisket, etc. which are all smoked in house, by the owner, Jim. The menu also offers surprisingly good pizza, of which they usually offer a rotating gourmet style speciality. The crust tastes homemade and is crispy, and the toppings are fresh and generously applied. Another item that we have tried are are the burgers. Again, freshly made, nicely sized, and delicious. 

The side dishes are quite generously sized. (I know I keep using generously, but it's true! Try the house made chips, you get a small mountain of them. the french fries with rosemary are the same way!)
 
Another cool thing they do is offer Smoked hams and turkeys for the holidays. We got a smoked ham for Christmas, and it was incredible! They offer a different cut than you get at the grocery store, tender, delicious, and unique. 

Lastly, service has Been first rate on every visit, friendly and attentive. 

So to sum things up, Great Q, nice size portions, consistent food quality, and service. Nice variety of non Q offerings on the menu, and an overall good value. 

Food Giants rating system;  5* = Freakin' Great. 4* = Really Darn Good.  3* = sure, why not, 2*= it's better than starving, 1* = A hungry homeless person, after one bite,  wouldn't eat this, even if you gave it to them for free.

In a city dominated by smoked meat (which I also like, just to make it clear), I cannot even begin to tell you how much better my life has become since I ran into this place on Yelp.

Hands down, the best fried chicken in Montréal. Also to add to that resume, I'd say almost inarguably the best fries in Montréal. Guys, just listen. Those fries stay crispy even when left out cold. HOW DO THEY DO THAT? The fries are so good, the fries are so good, the fries are so good. 

The fried chicken is also really delicious. Both the leg/wing and the breast: oh god, flavour right down to the bone. And the chicken nuggets. UNREAL. These are nothing like McDonalds nuggets. These are pieces of real chicken deep fried to create the same crust as your regular fried chicken. So good.

They also have chicken poutine using fried chicken. Need I say more?

On Tuesday, December 22, I had the misfortune of being rudely treated by one of the employees, Eric. I was in complete disbelief that I was being treated so unprofessionally. His encounters with me were certainly not an isolated incident, as many people were treated rudely as well. When they would ask him for a quick second, he would sternly cut them off and tell them that they would have to wait for him to finish what he was doing. This happened to other customers several times, and to me, twice. Even with little questions such as ""is this where I stand in line"" or ""do you guys sell gift cards"". When he was behind the counter, he was rolling his eyes and talking badly about the customers walking around the store. 

When I was checking out with my purchases, he rudely talked down to me as if I did not know what I was purchasing and then proceeded to practically throw the receipt at me. 

The entire visit and my entire experience with him leads me to believe he either absolutely hates his job or was just angry and can't help but to take it out on customers, who solely look to him for help. I'm sorry it's such a hassle that you have to help out customers and do your job, Eric.

After reading the reviews on here before mine, I can tell that others have been treated rudely by the sales associates too and I am not surprised.

My experience after I walked out of the store was TERRIBLE. I will NEVER buy from Rooms To Go again. It was awful. After waiting almost 2 weeks to get my couch, the delivery people forgot the legs to the ottoman. They told us they would overnight the legs when they got back to the warehouse and that they were easy enough for us to install or we could set up a service appointment once we got the legs. This was a Friday and they delivered just before 5pm so I figured they wouldn't get the legs sent out Friday so I waited a few days (until Wednesday) and still no legs. I called the Customer Care Center and they made it out to be my fault that I didn't call to tell them the legs weren't delivered. They said that there was no note on my account that the legs were missing and that the delivery people can't ship parts, let alone overnight them. I don't know how I was supposed to know that since this is my first purchase from Rooms To Go. So then they say it will be 5-7 business days for the legs to get to me. The time of this phone call is now 5 days after the furniture was delivered. I was so mad and let them know. I then called this Rooms To Go location to talk to them because I was upset. They said that they will take the information and forward to a Customer Care Center Supervisor and that the supervisor would be calling me by the end of the day (which was still Wednesday). I never got a call. I called back to the Customer Care Center Thursday afternoon and asked why someone didn't call and they said they didn't receive the request from the store! They did say that my legs were sent out that morning (Thursday) and would be arriving to me on Friday. I called the store to figure out why they hadn't forwarded the request and they said that they did. They also told me that the legs wouldn't arrive until Saturday. RIght there, conflicting information. Well, the legs FINALLY showed up Saturday at 5:15pm (ish). We couldn't install them ourselves like the delivery guys had said because we don't have the right tool to do so. So I called the Customer Care Center again. Well they close at 4:30pm on Saturday (8 days after the furniture was delivered) so then I had to wait until Monday to even be able to schedule the service request for the legs. So I call Monday. They say the FIRST day they can come is Thursday (which is Christmas Eve and 13 days after the furniture was delivered). I agreed since I had no other option. Then on Wednesday, I got a text and 3 phone calls to let me know that the 4 hour window was 9am-1pm. I'm also told the tech will call prior to arriving. So Thursday morning comes around, no phone call the guy shows up. Fine. I let him in and he says that about 90% of his service calls are for ottomans not having the legs. He was in my house for 3 mins. 3 MINUTES!! Yet I had to wait. I called the Customer Care Center to just tell them how disappointed I was and all they had to say is that they will note the account. NEVER ONCE did they apologize. Some of the WORST customer service I have EVER received. I also sent an email to Customer Service and their only response was that the legs were scheduled to be installed.

Strike #1

When me and my family of 5 arrived for my cousins birthday, the restaraunt was below freezing temperature. I've been to many over air conditioned establishment ( movie theatres for example) but this was beyond cold. It almost felt like sitting in a fridge. It was so cold we literally had to grab our jackets, shawl, and even a blanket from our car ( I'm literally not exaggerating). We kindly asked management to turn it down. He said he would tune it off but by the end of our dinner although it was a little less freezing we still felt the cold breeze coming from the vents. One of the women I was taking to when I went to the restroom told me she asked for her and her party to be seated outside on the patio because they couldn't take the freezing restaraunt.

Strike #2

After waiting over an hour for our food, we asked them if we could have some cheesy garlic bread twists to snack on. 3 of us ordered 2 twists each. The waiter said she would get it and bring it for us. 2 minutes later she came back to the table and asked if we still wanted the twists ... we said yes. 5 minutes later she comes back with complimentary chips and dip from management and asks again if we still wanted the twists... we said yes. She responds by saying ""ok, let me see if we have enough"" mind you, we are only asking for 6 twists. 5 minutes later she brings us this ( please see first picture), what looks to be old pieces of bread cut up and toasted with shredded cheese on top ( not twists!). At this point we knew they were out of twists and instead of telling us they decided to con us. 10 mins later we finally get our dry and flavourless food. My cousin ( who's birthday it was) ordered the same twists with her pasta and funny enough she actually got the twists. Looks like they might have only had one or two left and they saved it for my cousins meal. And can you imagine the waitress had the nerve to try and charge us for the old toasted bread with melted cheese. I had to kindly ask her to remove it because they weren't the real twists. ( please see picture of what the twists were suppose to look like in the second picture)

There was only one other occupied table, though parking took a while because the lot was pretty full from the other businesses in the plaza. 

There was only one waitress working, which made sense considering the number of patrons in the restaurant. She gave us the menus and brought out the usual side dishes but we had to ask for utensils...but it took a while to be able to ask her because she kind of disappeared after bringing out the sides and our waters! As a result, there were a few minutes where we were just staring at the food, contemplating whether to eat it with our hands out of desperation because we were so hungry, even though the lettuce was kind of wilted. Luckily we were able to hold off until our utensils came, which is when we ordered our food. The waitress was nice enough but the service wasn't particularly friendly or memorable. 

I got a kebob (beef and lamb) in a laffa with a side of fries, and asked for fries to be put inside the laffa too. My friend got something similar, also with fries inside. Of course, when the food came out, there were no fries to be found inside either of our wraps. We had fries on the side anyway, so we didn't bother waiting for the food to be remade after telling the waitress that there were no fries inside.

This place got a new sign ""SHAWARMA"" which lead me to try it out.  Stouffville doesn't have any shawarma so we were excited to give it a try.

What a mistake that was.  The guy making the shawarma had no idea what he was doing.  It was almost like it was his first time making a shawarma.  Who puts tahini and garlic sauce on the bread before anything else?  Never seen that done.  As well what kind of Greek place doesn't have hummus??  He didn't know how to wrap the shawarma either and it was all coming apart.  He had to hold it with his hand and a lid while grilling it so everything didn't fall out.  

On top of that it was terrible to taste, the ingredients were all terrible and nothing tasted fresh.  The meat was even cold inside.  Definitely the worst shawarma I've ever had in my life and I've had hundreds.  I wouldn't even call this a shawarma, just a sad attempt at making one.  

I also asked for a Greek salad.  I can go to a Pakistani restaurant and I'm sure they know how to make me a Greek salad.  You can go anywhere in the world and they know what the hell a Greek salad is.  Apparently not everywhere, this place which is called GREEK STOP doesn't even know what a Greek salad is.  Who puts diced tomatoes, shredded carrots and green peppers in a Greek salad??? WTF is that??  I thought maybe it will taste OK so I took it anyway.

This place is a complete waste of time and money and I would never go there again and hope they soon close down and save themselves more embarrassment.  I've never in my life actually wanted to go back somewhere to ask them to taste it themselves so they can see what they are serving people.

As many of the other reviewers have said, it's a pricey place and there is no debate over that!

However, it's such a pleasant experience to go there browse and pick out a cool tea to try out, some spices or ramen brands you won't find anywhere near by!

Not because I don't think they deserve it but it's never a consistently bad restaurant/store etc. There are good days and there are bad days, so basing a 1-star review on a single encounter is, in my opinion, not a true sense of the establishment.

I have visited this particular Holt Renfrew location multiple times over the course of my entire shopping career. I think I've bought a total of one thing from here, which was a birthday gift for my mother back when I knew nothing about customer service and what it should be like. And let me tell you, I don't think the workers here know what customer service is either.

Everyone that works here is so snotty, for no apparant reason. Well, I mean how could not be if you worked in a department store in a mall. Yeah... I don't know where this holier than thou attitude comes from but it's ridiculous. You may be the keeper of the designer digs and $100+ cosmetics but I'm the one shelling out to overpay for this stuff so don't give me the attitude that you're better than me. Most of the time, there are about 3 of them standing together doing nothing yet, I have never once heard a greeting as I walk in.

The set up inside is also terrible. The makeup counters and accessories area is crowded and the laneways are tight and they try to shove so much into this little space that it's hard to navigate when there are a few more people. It gets better in the clothing section but they seem to not be utilizing the space that they were given instead of shoving stuff in every nook and cranny. 

I'm not going to lie, I always walk in whenever I'm in Yorkdale mall but I've never bought anything, it just feels good to touch all of their stuff knowing that I won't purchase, I even once purposely came here to return something that I had bought at the Bloor street location, take that snotty workers.",352,11/12/2009 18:50,TRUE,1

The service at this location is down right disgusting!  Clearly the bartender/server working here has not been trained nor does she grasp the concept of ""hospitality"".

I made a 2nd visit when I should have learned from my first experience and now fully regret it.  Upon my visit, I asked for the Sunday special which included a pitcher of beer (60 oz.), 2 lbs of wings, fries and carrots/celery.  As she started pouring the pitcher, I asked for it to be served in a pint glass since the majority of bars I have gone to will NOT serve a pitcher to one person but instead follow the 24 oz maximum serving size rule.  Upon my request, she was happy to comply and it was my assumption that she would have given me the Pint #2 and Pint #3 as I finished the preceding Pint.  Instead, she shockingly dropped all 3 Pints in front of me which was very odd.  I asked her to place the other 2 pints in the fridge for me.  She did this!

A friend of mine arrived within 10 minutes and we moved to a table next to the bar.  Within a minute of us sitting down, the bartender/server appears with one of my beers (Coors Light) and hands it to my friend.  My friend gives me a puzzled look since he does not drink light beer nor did he get a chance to order his beer.

After waiting 15 minutes to get our food order, we decided that the service was beyond ridiculous.  There was only 1 individual at the bar and a table with 3 people in the entire restaurant.  She spent the majority of her time behind the bar chatting with the customer and not doing her job.

We did not finish our beers and my 3rd beer remained int he fridge.  I asked for the bill and she charged me for the entire pitcher.  In return I left no tip.  

Very disappointing since the Wild Wings franchise ramped up their advertising last summer to increase their traffic with an improved menu.

It's down the road from me so if I am walking past on my way home from a night out then it seems like a good idea, but it usually isn't.

The place is absolutely tiny. You walk in and hope it's not crowded because I can't imagine what it would be like when things are standing room only.

NkAfLXjVVI1hSPuwk3hrRg,SwShKJQ2doxoDxaUuYOf6A,_a_tio6zND31Wp5B3rn2uQ,1,8,1,0,"To start... I'm pretty sure some of the recent reviews I read about this place were fictitious. They advertise this place as luxury apartments and that is a complete joke.

I moved to these apartments without having ever lived in Las Vegas before and let me tell you, I am extremely disappointed. I can't believe that I pay over $1000 a month for these small, terribly built, poorly managed apartments. 

They advertise having a security gate, however, I have been here over a month and the gate has been open every single day. They say they are waiting on everyone to come get their game openers. Doesnt seem like it should take that long to hand out gate openers. Since I've been here my wallet has been stolen from my car and a neighbors vehicle has been stolen. I have also heard people complain about their apartments being broken into. I have no doubt that this is due to the security gate being always open. We literally live next to a bar/gas station/ liquor store. 

They claim to have over night security. Yes, I have seen someone wearing a shirt that says ""security"" on it, but he is either texting on his phone or working out in the gym when I've see him. 

There are pictures on the website of a playground, but what the don't tell you is that the bedding of the playgroung is 50% wood chips and 50% cigarette butts. Seriously, this playgroung is so disgusting that I would not let my children play on it at first sight. 

Speaking of how this place is not child friendly, what they do not advertise about is the stove and ovens. These units have GAS stoves with the knobs on the front, not in the back. The units look like they're from the 1990's and they offer no replacements or child friendly devices to help out. After my small child turned the stove on and left it on all night, the gas leak not being discovered for almost 14 hours, the CO2 alarm never went off. I have contacted maintenance twice regarding this issue and they never even came by to check my alarm which is clearly out of date. 

Maintenance is very slow in these apartments, taking at least a week to respond to work orders, if at all. Sometime they will come up with excuses to why they could not come to your apartment after all. 

There is an abundance of parking spaces, but for some reason, you only get yo park one vehicle under the half ass awning even though there are plenty of open spaces. They are partering with a towing company to drive around at night and if you have more than one vehicle parking under the awning, they'll tow your vehicle. Doesn't really make a whole lot of sense. They have signs saying you can't back into your spot to make it easier on the towing company. 

They advertise as pet friendly, but their pet waste bins are constantly full and there are never new bags at the station. Sometime they aren't pet friendly and sometimes they are too pet friendly. My downstairs neighbor has a pet that must pee in their hallway because there is a smell in my hallway closet that keeps coming back. I called maintenance about it and they came and sprayed some fabreeze. It still stinks. 

The dumpster locations are far and few between a having maybe four locations for the entire complex although each location has about six dumpsters in each. 

Again, these are NOT luxury apartments. Please beware that all these photos listed of their pool and leasing office is NOT actually how these apartments look.",620,9/28/2015 9:40,FALSE,0.110670385

I've lived in Las Vegas for 13 years and I discovered this place about 2 years ago when it was under different ownership. The majority of the original crew is still there, the quality of the service has always been great, but now it's even better. They upgraded their system so you actually receive a text message to confirm and remind you of your appointment, I hear the website will allow you to book appointments online soon. 

At first I though it was a little out of my budget, but then I realized how perfect every cut is and how great it is to be treated like they appreciate the business. The hot towel treatment is great and the neck massage is a real treat after a long day in front of a computer screen.  

I have a personal favorite employee that I won't mention by name (because I'm selfish and I don't want her to get too popular), but I know from experience it doesn't matter who cuts your hair, the quality of the cut and the service is excellent. 

Did I mention they offer a hot towel and a shave for a few bucks extra?

We ordered some spring rolls and basil chicken wings as appetizers.  For the mains, I got bun bo hue and the wife had pho tai Bo Vien.

Let me begin by saying that the spring rolls were alright.  It had a very ""homemade"" taste to it.  Viet people who grew up and had their mom's spring rolls as a kid will know what I mean which isn't a bad thing.  They were a bit on the soggy side but they jam packed the filling.  Next was the basil fried chicken.  This was a major fail! The chicken was super tasteless as if all they did was fried up some chicken and tossed in some fresh basil and called it basil fried chicken.  I had to dunk the wings in my fish sauce that came with the spring rolls to actually finish the wings.  Very disappointed.  If you really want to see how a pho place does chicken wings, check out Pho Hung's fried chicken!

Anyway, let's move on to our mains.  Nothing really outstanding here.  My broth in my bun bo hue tasted very diluted and my wife's pho bowl was SUPER oily.  

Hate to do this to up and coming restaurants but due to the wide selection of pho places around, your pho and menu gotta be on point to compete and I think this restaurant doesn't stand a chance if they keep doing what they do.",264,1/10/2018 15:08,FALSE,0.173480609

A spin off from their popular Union Station location, Amano Kitchen is open to satisfy your lunch, dinner, or take out needs. 

When you try a new restaurant, you have two choices, cautiously sample the menu or jump in with both feet.  I decided to do that later and ""Let Us (Amano) Cook for You"". For $49pp, the concept of this four course open menu is quite simple.  THE CHEFS CHOICE, and you will literally not know what you will get from the menu and was described as literally what the chef is in the mood to dish up - are they bored of serving up beef, lets consider Sea Bass this time.  

The four courses include: a charcuterie board; a pasta dish; main entree, and desert.  

To be safe, the waiter asked if there were any definite no go's on the menu or allergies.  After all, what would be more of a disappointment then being served something you would not order unless you were starving, and even then -- choosing not to eat.  

I am not going to go into every dish, after all, part of the experience is enjoying the food for yourself.  However, here is what I am going to add about Amano.

Without a doubt, this has to have been one of my most satisfying dining experiences in recent memory and worth checking out. The food is fresh, flavourful, and inviting with a fair portion size. Most times I have visited an italian resturant I ask myself why I didn't bother just throwing pasta in a pot at home and binging netflix.  This is nothing against Italian food - however, rarely an experience to talk about. In the case of Amano, WOW factors came to mind, with the blending of flavours and ingredients.  The pasta was fresh, the menu (I wish I had grabbed a photo) had something for everyone.  Spoiler: They make amazing, melt in you mount Pork Belly.  Amano had a nice wine list, and some signature italian sodas to round off the menu.

I had only two criticisms from my Let Us Cook for You menu.  One, the charcuterie board featured a healthy dose of Pork Belly; which was duplicated as a main entree, as well as they made Pork Belly, it was a bit of a disappointment considering the all of the options available on the menu.  It is also the least expensive entree item, humm.  Secondly, as much as the meal was designed as a sharing experience they skimped on the desert and only brought on strawberry cheese cake, made with fresh Ontario berries, to share. Although, to their credit - in recognizing our disappointment, a second dessert arrived with our latte order (a tasty Panna cotta topped with lemon pudding and blackberries).

The restaurant, only open a few weeks now is new, fresh and inviting.  Seating ranges from bar like seating against the open concept kitchen (equipped with mobile charging plugs), cozy tables and larger high tabels for groups or less inimitate encounters. The only downfall, is that they are limited to Mall Hours so if you want to have a relaxed meal be sure to get there early.

Over all, a great experience and I will be back to try their Sea Bass entree and to explore their take out menu / items.",576,10/4/2018 14:23,TRUE,1

We were with this clinic for several years before we finally decided to look for better care. They (Dr. Lee) were EXTREMELY rude, impatient, and expensive. Dr. Lee hardly gave us the time of day. He would walk into the office without greeting us, was very short, and did not allow any time for us to ask questions. My family and I have a dog with diabetes, and we have to give her insulin 2x/day. They were charging us $58 monthly for the insulin; we have since found the same insulin for $42. When we asked why the price was so high, we were told that we ""had no idea what other veterinarians were charging. Take the insulin or don't."" 

Once we were given a $400 estimate for a procedure that we felt was fair, and signed off on it. Upon picking up our dog, the bill was THREE HUNDRED dollars more than the estimate we were given. We asked why it was so much more than what we had previously been told, and the front desk secretaries were EXTREMELY rude saying that we had already signed off. They were unwilling to explain the difference in the quote/actual bill or budge on the price. 

Subsequently, soon after this incident, we received a letter saying that they would not provide care for our dog any longer. This was immediately following a serious illness, which required a veterinarian who knew our dog well for follow up care. It put us in a very difficult situation, left us without care for our beloved dog, and responsible for paying a $700 bill to which we did not sign off on, or know of prior to the treatment.

I recently had to travel to Las Vegas, for work, from out of state. During my trip, to LV, my chronic Diverticulitis decided to rear it's ugly head. By midday, I was in a considerable amount of pain. I called my G.I. Doc, back in my home state, to get a prescription sent over, for the usual antibiotics. Unfortunately, due to his medical license, he was unable to send the prescription, directly to an out of state pharmacy. He had the great idea, to send it to a Walgreens, near his office, then see if the LV location could transfer it. The LV Walgreens was indeed then able to transfer it, to their location, via their internal computer system.

I was in touch with Dave, in the LV pharmacy a few times by phone and he was just incredibly helpful. Very ""matter of fact"" and no-nonsense. My kind of guy, really. He never made me feel like I was making him go out of his way, or anything of the like. He was the one who initiated the transfer, told me when to head over, from the hotel, so I wouldn't get there after he closed for the night, etc.

After all this, the last thing I needed, was another problem, but... that was not to be, curse my luck. Unbeknownst to me, my most recent medical insurance card (which I DID have on me) DOES NOT have my prescription coverage information. (Separate card, now, apparently). Dave once again came to my rescue. He called my usual pharmacy, back home. Different company, completely. He was able to quickly get my current prescription coverage info, which they have on file. He then went over the meds with me, meticulously and made sure I understood all the ""do's and dont's"". I shook his hand and thanked him, profusely. He smiled and wished me all the best and his hopes that I started feeling better, soon. Just an all-around great man.

But ever since they've combined their restaurant with China A Go Go and became one establishment, they've added the name Sushi House. So if you order take out, you might be directed to either side when you pick it up. They do delivery as well and are usually on time. Never had a problem with that.

Their main menu looks completely different, as it only looks like they serve sushi, but you can still order all the same Hawaiian food items from before. They've even kept their old menu taped on their window!

They offer All You Can Eat (AYCE) sushi for both lunch and dinner. I personally haven't done AYCE here, but I've ordered to go countless of times. I've tried almost all of the sushi on the menu and it always turns out yummy and fresh. Prices seem to be in the same range as other AYCE restaurants as well.

It's not my go-to sushi place, but it's a great joint when you're craving for something quick and you're in the area. Plus it's far from where I live and I wouldn't travel all this way for this restaurant compared to other authentic Japanese sushi houses.

Staff is not very personable when it comes to customer service, which may come off as being unfriendly to some. But it doesn't really bother me since I only get food to go when I'm in the area visiting friends.

It's a great place to try when you're not looking for formality in an eatery and when you just need to feed your tummy with good food. lol

Don't get me wrong--I enjoy this park, but there are some aspects that preclude me from awarding it a 4.  The main reason is that, as another reviewer mentioned, this park isn't the most conducive to pedestrians in the section between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge.  In that section, there is at least as much road as there is path, and if you're on foot or bike, you have to cross it at at least one point.  This section also isn't as scenic as it could be, due to the presence of the wharf (though I'm sure I'd appreciate that aspect of the park more if I had a boat).  Finally, the cool little section with the gazebo that Chelsea S. took a picture of is prone to flooding if the water level's high, which makes it unusable and less than picturesque.

Having said all of that, this park definitely has some redeeming factors.  First, as I already mentioned, the bike trail runs through it, which is great, and is definitely more scenic than it is on the other side of the river.  Second, the section down by South Side Works is quite nice, and offers a great view of the Mon.  Third, the park has picnic tables in both the sections between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge and at South Side Works, which make for a great opportunity to enjoy a picnic in view of the river.  Finally, the city seems to be working its way down this park from the Hot Metal Bridge installing improvements--the latest of which is a new marina next to South Side Works.  It's clear that they have a master plan for this park, and the improvements definitely have improved the park, as is evident in the South Side Works section.

Overall, this park provides some much needed green space in the South Side, and is a boon to its residents and cyclists enjoying the trails.  However, there's no comparison between it and the larger parks in the city, such as Frick and Schenley, or even Highland Park.  It'll be interesting to see how things shape up in the next couple of years, as the city continues to improve it.  3.5 stars.",406,6/12/2015 14:32,TRUE,0.148406508

They always have my favourite hokkagai (surf clam) and the shrimp tempura is really good.

we ordered the fried tofu , McBau , cod balls and duck wings. 

The $7 spent for just one Bau that was the size of a tennis ball that is supposed to taste like a  $5.25 Mcdonalds sandwich just didn't make sense to me. Anything for the snap right?  It was good- but my mind was not blown. Actually is was barely impressed.

General Tso Crispy Confit Duck Wings was good bang for your buck and it actually tasted decent. The drumstick on the duck wing is the same size as a chickens leg drumstick. So it was a decent portion. The sauce and garnish was nice. Again this time i was satisfied- at best!

The disappointment of the night came with KFC Popcorn Tofu and it is probably why I could not enjoy the rest of my meals as much. SALT! biting into felt like I dove head first into the dead sea. Beer and other garnishes couldn't wash away the saltiness it left on my tongue. However, we did tell the server and they knocked it off the bill. Which was really great service

By the time I got to the cashier myself she was fine and relaxed. It was just the commotion I could hear while shopping that seemed crazy. I almost didn't continue because it seemed like it would take forever to get through the line. 

The selection is better than I find at Ross or Target and alike stores but here's where they lose major points: I can never tell how much anything is!!! I don't have a lot of money to spend on clothes but I do eventually have no choice. I refuse to pay $40 or more on a top. That's ridiculous but the sale signs make it seem doable. However, I find a top, see the tag (let's say $48) then look at the chart on the rack. It'll say, ""if the tag is $37 it's on sale for $19, if the tag says $42 it's now $30, etc.) But so many times the price on the tag is not listed on the chart so I have no freaking idea how much it really is. Instead of making everything up and having ""sales"" that you really want to sell it for, just put the price on the freaking tag!!! Or have everything in the right spot.

I can't come here and count on sticking to my budget and I don't have time to waste checking tag then sign and looking for the right sign only to possibly look like an idiot holding up the line because I have to put stuff back I thought was $12 but was really $50.

Long version:
After a stressful day, I crave comfort food, and today it was pho. As this is relatively close to work, I decided to check it out. I was encouraged (because authentic pho restaurants tend not to want to accept CCs) but hesitant when I saw the cash or debit only sign. The servers inside kindly told me there was no minimum I had to spend to use my debit card, for which I was grateful. 

I was seated in a dining room with modern decor, kept incredibly clean, and given an easy to navigate menu with items described in English, Vietnamese, and Chinese. The servers were super sweet, even helping me when I struggled to connect to WiFi. The atmosphere, service, and cleanliness here are top notch.

However, I care more about the food. I ordered the regular sized Pho Dac Biet, which is $10. The size was smaller than usual for the price. I got a measly 2 slices of beef, 1 piece of tripe, 1 piece of tendon, and 2 tiny beef balls. The broth tasted like something out of a can, completely lacking in depth of flavor. It filled me up, but it was not pho-nomenal.

I would recommend this place to introduce pho to people that have high expectations for service and cleanliness, but not for people looking for serious flavor at an affordable price.",245,9/27/2018 22:43,FALSE,0.082686294

I wasn't feeling too hot at 11:30 at night after a slight bout of food poisoning a few days prior and had just begun to get my appetite back after eating nothing all day. I wasn't too keen on consuming anything too heavy so I figured I'd call the restaurant which, according to its awning, has had a pretty good reputation for 60 years.

""Hi there,"" I said as my stomach growled in the background. ""Do you guys have chicken soup?""

""Our soup of the day is lentil,"" a kindly female voice replied. 

""Bummer. Well I wasn't feeling very well and was looking for something light to fill me up because I have been ill. Thanks for your time anyway.""

I was about to hang up when the kindly female voice assured me that she would indeed make chicken soup from scratch and that I should stop by in a half an hour. 

Surprised at such magnanimity, I hung up the phone with famished bemusement.

At midnight I walked in and introduced myself. 

""Hello there,"" I said as I extended my hand with gratitude and humility. ""I was the one who called and requested the chicken soup.""

A slight woman with short grey hair grabbed my hand and with a smile that could warm the heart of someone with the most frigid of demeanors said, ""I'm Miriam and I treated you and made this soup as if you were one of my own children."" 

Needless to say it was the best chicken soup I ever had and when I called her back 20 minutes later after finishing the entire container I told her so. 

It was so good in fact and I was so touched by her effort that I said that I was going to sign up for Yelp and write a review because the world needs to know that kindness and culinary expertise are not mutually exclusive.

So I hope you have enjoyed my first official yelp review dear reader. Never has a woman like Miriam or her place of employ - Vesta Lunch deserved it more.

The location was clean and orderly when I visited but it was also completely dead. I was quickly greeted by two teen girls when I walked in who were ready to offer help. I had come on a mission to relive the childhood glory of having an ice cream cake for my birthday. After I picked out my cake the girls asked if I wanted anything written on it and let me pick a color and even clarified if I wanted an exclamation point. Service: five stars. However, it's not enough to bump up the star rating of this review.

Quality: two stars. So sad. I know my palate has changed since I was a kid, but I really think they've changed their recipes. 
+ Caramel and crunchies: still delicious and gooey and the reason for getting DQ over Carvel or a store brand. Never change, filling! It's exactly as I remember it. 
- The ""whipped cream"" decorative frosting. I was obsessed with the light, fluffy frosting that made the flowers and decorated the edges of the cake. Now it is heavy and tastes like food coloring and seems like it's made with corn syrup. Such a bummer. I've been craving this frosting for years and it doesn't look like I'll ever have it again. 
- The ice cream itself. It has no flavor aside from a sort of milky quality. If you blindfolded me I'd have no idea there was a difference between the chocolate and vanilla layers. The chocolate layer is so light it barely registers as a different color. Their website photos show the cakes as I remember them; my cake was not a chocolatey wonder. I still eat my cake in the same way I did as a kid - eat the frosting, eat the vanilla, eat the chocolate, then eat the filling. I might as well just eat it like a normal person now because the filling is the only thing with flavor.

Two foot tubs were prepped and filled with water. Husband was attended to while I waited with feet in the tub for about 15 minutes until the other nail tech finished with her client. Appreciated that they warmed up the water while I was waiting. At least I was able to make use of the message chair all that time. I did feel for my husband as his pedi was a bit painful at times. The nail tech was very apologetic but it was not a relaxing or enjoyable pedi for him.

After all that time having my feet submerged in the water, I was attended to and the pedi was done quickly. By this time there were customers waiting and only two nail techs working the floor. I understood. The nail tech left some edges unpainted but at this point I did not want to pull her away from her customer.

ABOUT THE SPACE
There is a wall that showcases a large variety of nail colors from various name brands. Many looked old and low on polish. I usually like to see fresh and new nail polish bottles, especially new in-season options. 

Message chairs are nice and looked worn in. They do the job. There is a small flat screen across from that area that you can watch during your pedi service. 

FINAL THOUGHTS
Overall, the salon itself is very spacious, bright, and fairly clean. Not very zen-like colors on the walls or any decor to soften lines or to instill a cozy feel. Nail techs were friendly. Pricing is fair. Good for those looking for affordable nail services with no frills and thrills offered at spa nail salons. I did read they offer a free cocktail with a service on Monday - Thursday between certain hours. This is a fairly new business and a nice add in the Mint Hill area.

You can choose from 4 different buns and 9 different burgers. There's also the option of Classic Toppings & Premium Toppings. Moving on they have a list of specialty options like Reuben & Fish Sandwiches. There's also Poutine, Giant Onion Rings and different Fries options. 

I decided to go for a classic so I could really taste the meat, I obviously had to add cheddar cheese and I stuck with Classic Toppings like pickles, lettuce, onion, ketchup and mustard. What I really liked is that homemade taste, the meat had a good taste to it and it had a great char - just like a classic hamburger. The bun was very soft and all the toppings were great quality. I'm a huge Poutine lover so I had to give that a try, it was pretty good. The gravy tasted great and the cheese curds were squeaky. 

The owner had just finished making his own special burger which was being released the next day, and asked if I wanted to split it... um obviously. He had created a Greek Inspired Burger which was not bad, I preferred the classic though.

Well, fixing it was not cheap, but Joel did not pressure me in any way; he told me what was needed and let me make the decision on my own. Ultimately, I  had the car fixed, and it is running like new.

I'll start with the good:

1. I was able to check in at 930am. I'm going to count that as a BIG plus because not many hotels allow that. However, I was flying from ottawa to Calgary direct and with the time change I got there super early. They quickly checked me in and it was awesome because I was exhausted and didn't want to wait around until 3pm for a room. 

2. The staff is super friendly - they treated me great and made sure I had what I needed when I asked for it. They also quickly changed my room when I had a concern. 

3. The bar is nice and the bartender was very friendly. The sad part, the close early. Like 10pm. 

The bad: 

1. The motor in the AC of my first room was broken and I had to ask them to please switch me to another room. They tried to send someone to fix it while I was there but that was a failure. Lol 

2. The second room I was in, the AC was ""working"" but it barely cooled. I was lucky if I got a tiny bit of cold air. It was so hot that I had to sit next to the AC to be cool enough to do my makeup. 

3. The fridge wasn't even plugged in and I had to fight with the fridge and pull it out to find the plug. 

4. You don't get your room cleaned unless you ask them to do it. Ok fine, I left at 9am and asked them to please have my room cleaned by 2pm because I would be back with company and then needed to get ready. Sadly, I got back at 3pm and my room was still not cleaned up. I had to call down. The front desk had forgotten to relay my message. Sigh! So if you are going to ask us to request a service in order to provide it, the least you can do is make sure you send the message over to housekeeping. 

5. The beds are super uncomfortable and old. The entire hotel is old. The rooms are not that great and the balconies are open for use but you cannot smoke outside. So, don't bother calling down to ask hehe! 

6. The shuttle needs to be scheduled ahead of time, so if you are at the airport you are SOL trying to get a ride. However, when I called the week before to ask about this they told me it wouldn't be a problem. Then when I tried to use the shuttle it wasn't available . Anyway, long story short. Book it ahead of time.

I  came with my daughter to purchase a coat and a pair of shoes. The shoes I wanted to purchase were over $1000.00 and so was the coat.  I decided to purchase the shoes first. We went to the shoe department. One sales person was servicing a customer, and 3 others were standing in a cluster having a chit chat. I approached one and asked for help. She was sweet and pleasant, however, I became quickly disappointed and ended up leaving without purchasing anything from Holts that day.  I asked to see 3 different styles of the shoe. She had helped me with two and told me that she was going to go to check on the third, but while she was helping me, some ""regular"" customers came into the department. She left me sitting and waiting for almost 10 minutes. I thought the wait was unusually long because the first 2 pairs came out from the back quickly.  When I turned around from where I was sitting to look for her, I saw her talking to them. I was extremely angry. I put my own shoes back on and left. They lost over a $2000.00 sale that day.

I have to mention for this location (not sure abut the others) they really stepped up their game within the last couple of months. 

My boyfriend and I came here for lunch and first thing we noticed are a bunch of limes at the side of the building sitting in the snow, the reason i'm mentioning this is because people could easily slip on them. The whole time we we're there till the end, the limes were still outside, no one cleaned them up. 
Anyway we we're greeted and seated and our server introduced herself. I got to say Kelsey's has a very inviting bar area. They also have pretty good specials. My boyfriend ordered one of the burgers called stack of something and it was on special for 9.99 +fries and i ordered the messy fish sandwich 12.99. 

The food looked ssoooo good when it arrived to our table. I ordered the messy fish sandwich before but it was never this good, the batter was perfect crunchy and not detached from the fish at all. It was a really good amount of fish and IT GETS REALLY MESSY. but its so worth it. I loved it
my boyfriend said he really enjoyed his burger, there was a lot of burger juices coming from it. good sign !! Also a couple  months prior we ordered the loaded nachos which were THE BOMB and battered calamari which i thought was a little tiny bit on the salty side. ALL in ALL I feel better about coming to Kelsey's now and they really do have a good menu and atmosphere.

The only thing i was not happy with which isn't a problem and most places do this, and have to stop is auction off food.

I was greeted by the lady you see in my photo and ordered some breakfast. My eggs are usually scrambled, but I decided to get them Sunny Side Up. 

The food was good and as I was about to take my last bite, the lady asked me how the meal was. We started talking about diners and why the food sometimes feels like home. Back in the 70s, the lady was just a little girl entering Vesta with her 6 siblings and father. They just arrived in Canada and Vesta was becoming their morning routine. She remembered how her father would proudly tell others that the 7 kids were his and it was there that she had eggs for the first time as breakfast. It just wasn't a breakfast item where she was from. 

When she explained how later she would call back home to her father to tell him that she now worked at this tiny diner, there was so much heart found in her voice. Her father, Canada as her new home and eggs for breakfast all become rooted in Vesta. The lady hopes to continue cooking there for a long time. 

I smiled back, told her I hope she can too, and took the last bite of my eggs. They really did taste Sunny Side Up.",287,2/14/2018 6:15,FALSE,0.071212842

2 weeks later, she or her daughter texted me saying my bag was finished. Flor was absolutely adorable and so friendly. Her business is inside her garage, but looks just like a shop.!

I've been looking for an Elvis shirt without any luck and thought why not. He said he could put any picture of Elvis to come in and they'll show me. He has a pc connected to a tv and starts google image searching Elvis pics. He asks me which one and I choose one and he says that they can also add wording to the bottom of the pic, so I had them add ""Viva Las Vegas"". They do a fast job, it's ready in 5 min. I stupidly give them my credit card expecting the total to be $20 plus tax but then the lady behind the counter says the total is $80. I immediately get upset an tell her that the guy told me it would be $20, she says that they start at $20 and depending on the picture and wording it goes up. She points to a small black & white barely legible 'price sheet' all the way in the corner of the counter (honestly you wouldn't notice it unless it's pointed out). I tell her that I refuse to pay $80 for a t-shirt, then she asks me what I want to pay. I tell her that $20 is what I want to pay and she argues that they did lettering and a large picture and if I can pay $35 at least. I just want to get out of there so I agree and it comes out to $37.50 with tax I guess.

I kept trying different places but nothing worked out except one in Vancouver Canada. I can't fly to Canada every time I need hair cut!

I saw this place on yelp, but no reviews. I searched on address and turned out this place has been around for more than 10 years under True Essence Salon.  After the name change, they kept the name ""AVEDA Concept"".  I trust the name AVEDA so it must be good and decided to try.

I arrived 10 mins before my appointment time and they took me to the spa area waiting room. Drinking a glass of water, and chatted with two other customers waiting. They both happened to be long time customers and they've been pleased with the service for a long time, and this made me feel good about this place.

One minute after my appointment time, my stylist Kelsey came to get me. When I first saw her, I immediately noticed on her beautiful hair, cute shoes and nicely done nails.  I thought if she takes time to take care of herself this much, she must know how to take care of others hair as well.

I really enjoyed the shampoo time. She put a nice hot towel around my neck while letting conditioner soak in and massaged my hands (and arms).  I was totally relaxed in the shampoo chair.

We talked about how I want for my hair cut and she asked some questions and made some suggestions how to make my hair look the best possible.  She is a true professional hair stylist and she knows what she is doing.  

While she was working on my hair, I kept watching other stylists work through the reflection on the mirror.  All of them had perfectly styled hair, especially one had nicely curled hair. I wondered how long it takes to do her hair every morning with curling iron... It shows they have time (or make time) to do their hair right, and they take time to take care of their clients hair too.

I also consulted with her about possibly start coloring to hide my ever growing grey hair as I am not getting younger.  She took time to explain what color will give what impression and how they make my face look.  She was so patient with me and explained everything I ever wanted to know about hair coloring.

We moved to Charlotte 2 months ago, and shopping for furniture was one of the first things we did.  We bought multiple rooms worth of furniture and spent many thousands of dollars at the store.  We waited 10 days for our first delivery.  The delivery guy says there is a part missing from our king sized bedframe and he can not put the bed together, so put the 4 huge boxes containing the bedframe in our garage.  Also the coffee table was not in stock, and the dining room table has a large chip right on the top.  He assures us he will let the company know, and that they would call me.  Several days go by (over new years holiday,  so I gave them a few days before calling).  I call customer service, and they tell me the delivery guy did'nt report anything, and they would resend the furniture.  The next week-same delivery guy comes and drops off the coffee table.  He sees the boxes still in the garage and laughs, saying oh I see they still have'nt fixed your stuff.  He quickly leaves, and I notice the entire corner of the table is crushed and broken in several spots.  I run out to the front of my house, and flag the guy down to take back the broken piece, and he gets in his truck and ignores me, then leaves.  I call customer service again, and again reschedule yet another delivery.  Another week goes by and a new delivery crew arrives.  They do not have the dining room table.  They inspect the bedframe boxes and say there is nothing missing, that it is likely that the first guy did'nt feel like putting it together, and that he has done this before.  They brought a new bed and put it together, but the footboard is damaged.  They checked the one in the garage, and it also is damaged.  They brought another coffee table, which was fine.  I am livid at this point about the first delivery guy and the continued deliveries of broken and missing items. I call the store, I called customer service multiple times.  I told them if they sent this driver to my home again, that I was not letting him in.  I was assured that my chart would be ""red flagged"", and a supervisor would call me by the end of the day.  No one ever called.  I called both back the next day, and scheduled delivery number 4.  On this delivery, the damaged bed frame was replaced, and the delivery guy tells me that the first time, it was not put together correctly and we are lucky it did not break.  They brought another dining room table-this one had a huge amount of damage.  They showed it to me on the truck and did not bring it in my home.  Calls again to customer service, where I'm told they will send someone to fix the chip instead.  Several more days go by, and a man comes bright and early at 8am on a Saturday.

The produce is of excellent quality and if you are looking for a specialty item (mostly Asian but also Italian, other European products and just a bunch of random stuff) this is the place where you're likely to find it... And if they don't have what you're looking for, ask them if they can order it and they might just order it specially for you - I know this because that's what they did for me one time and it didn't fully surprise me but it made me love this place even more.

Even if you just want to walk around the aisles and check out the interesting and unique products that they have, you won't be bored or disappointed.. And they have a huge selections of organic stuff.

The only thing is that, since they are a small store, they don't have a butcher so you could technically do all of your grocery shopping here so long as you go somewhere else to buy your meat.

But they do have an awesome sandwich station where you can have someone build you a wrap or sandwich and they are so reasonably priced and very tasty and they, of course, use the freshest products. They also bake fresh breads and pastries every morning, you can go at 8am and you'll see them pulling trays out of the oven to cool.. And they have pastries like meat patties and focaccia pizzas...

Morgan's carries many brands for a small store, such as Ecco, Dansko, Tsubo, Birkenstock, Merrell, Lowa, MBT, Teva, and even Vibram FiveFinger ""shoes"".  There's tons of other brands I'm missing, especially since I don't peruse the women's section.  Prices can range from $50 to ~$400.  Don't forget to check the sale racks!

They also have excellent service which is plentiful but not pushy.  The vibe I get is that they don't work on commission, and a friend who worked shoes for years felt the same way.  When you are thinking of making a purchase, it's apparent that they really know their stuff.  They take the time to make sure the shoe is the proper fit after first measuring your feet, and can also recommend a number of inserts and things as well.  In addition, they seem to have some specialists on staff (after checking their website, it's Pedorthists) that can help people with feet/back/etc. issues.

I've even come into this place when it was busy over the holidays looking only for some replacement laces, and when I tried to buy them the person at the register said ""no charge"".  I was nonplussed as that was so atypical for *anywhere*.  It's not often I enter a store,  acquire an item, and walk out without paying - that's usually called shoplifting...

I feel bad giving Morgan's 4 stars because they're expensive, as I don't know their margins.  I just wish more of the shoes were in my price range.  However, I can usually justify it when I eventually do make a purchase because their products are so durable and you know you're getting a good fit.

One helpful thing is that they have a card where for every $50 you spend you get a punch, and I think at something like $250 spent you get $50 off your next purchase?  I might have that wrong, so your mileage may vary.

So far I've bought my most expensive shoes ever there, in a pair of $250+ MBTs, and will come back for some Tsubos and Eccos.  If you're looking for a pair of shoes that will last and are willing to pay for it, you'll be fine here.

This place is best for groups of twos as their tables are rather narrow and the place is not too big. There was plenty of business as soon as the restaurant was open at 11 am and it was a third full by noon.

This place has a cute charm to it. They have lamented print of why you should eat fish as it is a rich source of Omega-3 and other vitamins.

I enjoyed my order of halibut and chips. The fries were long, sizeable and slightly crispy outside and super soft inside. They were neither skinny, burnt nor oily, too. The halibut had a thin batter and I could still taste the freshness of the actual fish.

Portions were rather generous. All orders come with a small side of either coleslaw or beets, which was surprising to me, since most of not all of the other (fish and chips) places that I have been to do not offer it alone as a side.

My friend did not know that the sizes would be as big and he was feeling rather hungry, so he made the mistake of ordering chicken nuggets and chips with another order of poutine. By the time, all of our food came, I asked him ""Are you sure you can eat all this? That is a lot of fries."" to which he responds ""Wow! I thought the poutine would just be snack size! Please definitely help me finish it.""

Well, I am not the biggest fan of gravy and I cannot handle cheese well, so I helped with ones that were not drenched in either or both. In the end, my friend had to ask for a takeout box and the owner lady was nice enough to give us a paper box and paper bag. The utensils here were also actual silver. Nice! No plastic here!

No wonder this place won a few awards and mentions from newspapers and even Yelp! Totally would recommend for a simple date or catching up with a friend, one on one. You can probably have a group of four or more if you put the table together.

We were both so full and neither of us spent that much even though I order their most expensive item and he order two items. Totally affordable and kid-friendly place, too. The owner lady was very polite. She immediately welcomed us with a bright smile and continuously pour us water and checked in on us without being asked.

I knew of the spot where they served Island food and some sushi rolls and now they've expanded to Chinese and All You Can Eat Sushi and Boba which is good for the Eastside.  

I skimmed through the Sushi menu and the Lisa Lisa roll caught my eye so I ordered that with the Seafood Combo (Mahi Mahi and Fried Shrimp) that came with one Meat choice (Short Ribs).

Lisa Lisa Roll is common in most sushi joints and I never really care for it but at this place I think what won me over is the ""crunch"" that was on top.  Something about it.  It was packed on tight on the top of the roll like.... packed snow.  Like fluffy ice!  That's what made it different from other sushi place, the fluffiness of the flakes.  It taste so good.  Plus, the ingredients in the roll look well proportioned.

As for the fish, shrimp and short ribs, it was okay.  Wasn't a fan of how the shrimp was fried because biting into it was super crunchy.  Let's compare it to Panda Express, it's crunchy batter around it but you get a tender bite of the shrimp and that's not what I got here.  More crunchy and an over cooked shrimp.  The short ribs and the Mahi Mahi was just ok for me.  The Mac Salad, I wasn't to impressed with.  It was a little runny for my liking.

I parked and checked in to the hotel. I had a friendly and fun person at the front desk. She asked whether I needed a late checkout, for she recognized that I was a gold elite member. I said that I needed to catch a flight in the morning, so I wouldn't need it.

My sense of humour made her laugh hard. I asked where the elevator was or if I had to haul my belongings up flights of stairs. She was kind to tell me where it was.

My room felt like home. It is an older hotel, but it worked just fine for me. The bed was comfy. The kitchenette was perfect. The shower pressure was fine. I had no complaints.

I got a bag of shrimp potstickers, and made them for breakfast and dinner on two separate days. I brought dinner in on my final night and was pleased that I had a decent meal in the comfort of my room. It truly felt like home.

More importantly, I slept well. It was far too noisy at the other hotel. I was well-rested at this hotel.

Housekeeping was great. My room was made every day. Everything was clean and perfect.

But what none of you know is that before it was any of those things, it was the capital of Wisconsin. Originally called Whisk-on-sin because they whisk the dairy products that they make here, and because a river of sin flows through the state. Er.

Actually what flows here is a beautiful lake. It's massive, and is a huge part of the beauty of the downtown area. The capitol building is also absolutely gorgeous, much like your sister was last night ohhhhh.

Madison has changed a lot. It was always a cool college town, but now the whole downtown area has been turned into one massive hipster college area. It's probably one of the most hipster areas I've ever been to. The difference between here and somewhere like Williamsburg and Brooklyn is that a lot of the people wandering around and doing the Hipster things are not so hairy and not so averse to showering. 

In fact they are absolutely gorgeous. There are some very good looking people attending University here in Madison. And even though summer does not last very long, walking around the central area will leave you gawking at some of the extremely revealing outfits and amazing bodies of both boys and girls. For young people who like looking at other sexy people, Downtown Madison really is the heart of Wisconsin.

Other than all the amazing stores and cool restaurants, you also have the aforementioned spectacular beauty of a massive Lake right next to the downtown, and of the amazing impressive Capitol Building dominating the scenery for miles. Definitely one of the most naturally beautiful capitals of any state, and when you combine it with all the sexiness, this is easily a Five Star City to visit that I have underrated for too long. 

Greenland Tea House is the best (and only authentic) Bubble Tea in town. I haven't had an amazing meal here yet. The Ian's Pizza slices are just OK. Paul's Pelmeni is very interesting and delightfully affordable, but neither healthy nor out-of-this-world. Other stuff here was too disappointing to mention.

Calamari ($9.75)
This was really tasty. Loved the spicy mayo served on top.

Black Trumpets - squid ink campanelle ($17.95)
squid ink pasta cooked in tomato sauce with marinated shrimp. The shrimp was cooked nicely, meat was bouncy and tasted fresh. Can't really taste the squid ink, which is normal I guess since it doesn't have any flavour. Love the texture of the pasta though, slightly chewy. Delicious.

Fat Tubes - rigatoni ($18.95)
pork, beef, and pancetta bolognese. Pasta was cooked nicely, great texture. I thought the taste was a little bland though. They recommended adding their special spicy sauce to the pasta which added a nice kick.

Cheesy polenta ($7.95)
First time eating polenta in this form. Mixed with corn ragu, cheese curds and wild mushrooms. Was tasty!

Food was kind of slow, I know we came on the weekend but it was a bit of a wait. Prices of the pasta were a little expensive imo.

My hair is stupid and weird, as I'm sure most people believe their hair to be, so it's always been a challenge to find someone who can give me a flattering and relatively modern cut that I like. Of course I turned to Yelp to try to find something close to home only to be disappointed with my first attempt at another close by salon. It left me very gun shy and I didn't cut my hair for over 6 months.

I took a chance on this place because it's an Aveda salon and I have had great luck with them in the past. The reservation system was a little unclear, I wasn't sure if I was really booked for the time I reserved. But I called to confirm, and it was on! I was booked with Joel. I was still nervous at that point but I just needed a cut so badly.

I was greeted by a lovely woman whose name I didn't catch, but she made me feel welcome immediately and asked if I wanted anything to drink. She then let Joel know I was there and he came out to greet me, totally friendly and gregarious. From there, just a great experience. I prefer to home dye and sometimes I get some shaming from stylists but not a sign of that from Joel. He listened to what I wanted and the problems I had with my hair and verified how much I was willing to cut off. A fabulous scalp massage, friendly conversation, and a fantastic cut and style followed! And even though I was the last customer on a Friday night, he took his time and did not seem to feel rushed at all.

However, because I am purist, unless I am listening to Classical Music live or on Vinyl played through an audiophile stereo (no 5.1 or 7.1 here, yuck!), don't even bother sharing.

So, when my friend acclimates me to the Downtown Chamber series; wherein Classical Music's top local talent plays at certain venues several times a year in a more intimate and informal environment, I was immediately intrigued by the idea.

He did inform me that they do play in uncharacteristic venues, that may or may not be sonically fine-tuned to such a precise musical art. 

Nevertheless, he had me at Informal!

You see, my wife doesn't quite like the formality and stuffiness that accompanies the enjoyment of Classical performances at Symphony Hall. Therefore, I often go solo while dressed up in my myriad of tuxes - even though I'm happily and delightfully attached.

What I was apprehensive about this particular performance was the fact that it was at the Monorchid, which is billed as an Industrial art type venue. It is often used to display local artists and their modern art. And on occasion, this venue is used for more formal events like weddings and such.

This was going to be a challenge. However, we got to wear jeans, sit on non-padded chairs, and enjoy some of Arizona's local virtuosity.

And virtuosity, it was!

The violins, oboe, double bass, clarinet, and viola all sounded so spectacular and sonorous. The combination of wood wind and stringed instruments, both masterfully performed in solo and group performances were simply magnificent.

We were seated in the back of the venue. This is because, except for the occasions wherein we always sit at the foremost seats; my shy wife prefers to sit away from wandering eyes of the crowd that easily fixates itself on the front seated patrons.

This venue should've been a train wreck of epic proportions. Concrete floors. Industrial metal panels. Open wood. The list goes on. But, the careful arrangement of the stage's wall, that deadened standing waves, and minimized the harmonics; made enjoying these performances such a pleasant surprise.

The only downside to this venue is that the parking is sparse. Unless you get here early, like we did, you will be hoofing it for some distance to get to the venue. The bathrooms are not equipped to handle 100 people in such a small space. And if it rains (which it did during this evening's performance), you can either get stuffed inside with the crowd, or try to find ample enough protection from the rain should you opt to stand outside to get some fresh air.

And he truly cares about you and how you're doing, and how your hair impacts your world. He always knows the exact color that works with my skin tone when I want to try something new.

I work on the same street as this mom and pop shop and was used to seeing the famous Wisey's Pie in the exact location where Urbun Eats is now. This is a relatively new business in the Leaside area, and I think it's got memorable qualities to make it a lasting gem. By that, I am specifically pointing to the service and quality of food.  

Upon entering, you will be greeted with a smile  by a boy who seems to be the son of the family running the place. This kid's got emotional labour and customer service down, that's for sure!  I like to know my options and thus tend to be the type to ask several questions to pinpoint my food selection. Even so, he handled it all with ease without any hesitation and was a careful listener.  You could honestly tell that he cares for the customer and has a good work ethic when it comes to providing stellar customer service. 

The food also has a magnitude of its own, mind you. I got the Urbun Smoke, which the boy recommended among other interesting items, with the Standard Combo. The Urbun Smoke was about 13 dollars and the Standard Combo, which included fries/onion rings and a pop, was 3 dollars.  Their burgers are priced at the gourmet tier, which may turn some potential diners away, but their quality of meats and portion size are their trump cards. Take a look at my burger - It. Is. Massive! I sent a photo to my friends and the size was all they kept talking about! 

Their variety is also refreshing. When you order a burger, you choose one of three buns: regular, seeded, and brioche. The family members are also helpful in advising about the best bun selection for the particular burger you're ordering, so don't sweat it.  I think the brioche bun would put a sweet spin on a chicken burger, so I'm eager to try that combination next.  In fact, I might like it more than chicken and waffles! Meat-wise, my Urbun Smoke had Montreal smoked meat in it and it tasted far better than bacon in a burger! The AAA beef patty was also not overcooked. Rather, I think it was medium to medium well done because I still had some pink patches in my patty. This ensured that each mouthful was soft rather than chewy.  This is gourmet burgers done right.

Right now, it's a hole in the wall type of joint, but I wouldn't be surprised if it gets its own hype when the area becomes busier after the LRT is finished. It's got all the works going for it anyway:

1. Customer service with a Can Do attitude

2. Portions that don't leave you hanging when you run out of cash to buy seconds 

3. Well-cooked and flavourful meats 

4. A type of bun for any mood",494,8/31/2017 5:11,TRUE,1

They try their best to open 24 hours on holidays, but it gets difficult without the manpower unfortunately.  Again, I genuinely appreciate all that USO does and this is the fanciest USO I've been to, but the hours of operation is the downer (when compared to other USOs).

Tip: hours are Sunday-Saturday 8am to 8pm!  They try their best to open 24 hours on holidays, but there's no guarantee, so call ahead if you are planning on coming here off hours!  They're great about picking up the phone!

My sister goes to this place every once in a while for a polish change, so when I was thinking about getting a manicure for myself I decided to come here. I never get my nails done because I can rarely afford it, so this was supposed to be a nice treat. 

I walked in and was greeted and I was told they could take me immediately. So I quickly chose my polish colors (I was in a bit of a hurry) and waited for them to seat me. It took about 10 minutes for someone to take me to a station. I told my nail technician that I only had about a half hour for the manicure, and she said that would be no problem.

 An hour later they told me that my nails were dry and I was ready to go. Since it took twice as long as they originally said, I had to rush home and change for an event. After changing, I got in my car and glanced down at my nails, only to see that each one was smudged, some nails had the polished completely wiped off. 

Frustrated, the next day I went in to have the polish re-done. One of the women who works there, an older lady, glanced at my nails and said that she didn't see anything wrong with them. Then when I pointed out all of the smudges, I was told that they were ""too busy"" and to come back in an hour. Well, they closed in less than an hour. I went to run one errand and came back about a half an hour and the same woman (the older lady) was rude again to me. I asked to speak with the owner, who I stepped outside with and explained my situation. 
She apologetically took me back in the store and set me up with my nail technician from the day before. This time she did a shellack manicure since it dries faster. When it came time for the top coat, the owner came over to do it her self. She snidely remarked that I was too impatient the day before and left before it was dry, which is not true. The fact that she had the nerve to say anything to me after the way I was treated the first two times was shocking. After my shellack dried, I left. 

The shellack manicure lasted 3 days, even with good upkeep (I put a clear coat on it and I am never very hard on my nails).

Both come as a generous platter of seasoned rice along with a fair amount of perfectly cooked meat, some caramelized onions, refreshing yogurt sauce, and some zhug (Yemeni hot sauce).
I must begin with the rice. It was quite possibly the best rice I've ever had. A myriad flavors, subtle and pronounced, joined together on my palate. I normally don't like spicy food, but this rice was just barely spicy, just enough so that it tickled my tongue in a most pleasant way. Come here for the rice if nothing else.

Since I broke my ankle my dining mainly revolves around delivered takeout. And mostly Thai takeout at that. In the last month I've tried quite a few different Thai places - and this one is currently at the bottom of my list.

I ordered online, which provides you with the option to add in any requests and a handy estimate of when your food will arrive. I usually order through SkipTheDishes because I find their online ordering system better, and usually it's their drivers. This restaurant has it's own drivers, which means there's no GPS tracking. As requested, the driver phoned when he arrived at my apartment building (just after the latest estimated delivery time) and I went downstairs to meet him. When he was nowhere to be seen, I called him with no answer and had to stand out by the road on crutches. He picked up the phone after 5 minutes and he'd gone to the wrong address. I did get my food, but I had to wait outside for more than 10 minutes - normally not a big deal but my broken ankle wasn't happy about it, especially when I'd noted in my order that I'm on crutches.

I tried the shrimp salad rolls, chicken fried rice, a beef stirfry and the coconut rice with mango. Overall I found the food a bit average in taste - plus less veggies in the fried rice than the other Thai places and no mushrooms in my beef stirfry - but they left in the onion that I requested to have taken out. I also had a really sore stomach after eating the food. Plus the coconut rice with mango was just mango. The restaurant notes that fresh mango isn't always available, so I requested to only have the dessert if fresh mango is available. Looks like they decided this meant I only wanted half of the dessert without checking.

I contacted SkipTheDishes about the delivery and dessert issues, who in turn contacted the business. It took almost a week for them to get back to me while waiting to hear back from Delicious Thai and the restaurant refunded the dessert.

For my 1000th review it seems only fitting to fête the city that's earned its place as my hometown. Combined, I've lived in Madison longer than anywhere else. I came for college at the University of Wisconsin, and despite heading off for stints in Austin and San Francisco, I've ended up back in these seventy-seven square miles. 

I love that Madison has the feel of a small town but offers much more than you'd find in a small community. Walkable neighborhoods, endless parks, more restaurants than I could cover in a year, and I can get virtually anywhere in town in thirty minutes or less...as long as I don't take the Beltline at rush hour. 

Some of the city's greatest hits: the Memorial Union Terrace, Concerts on the Square, Live on King Street, Olbrich Gardens, the Dane County Farmers Market, curds on curds, Babcock ice cream, beer boots, supper clubs, the Wisconsin Badgers, sunsets over the lake, free museums, State Street, the UW, cherry bounce old fashioneds, and an airport that often takes fewer than fifteen minutes from parking garage to boarding gate.

smyLZjnDPhWTRJ_Iu7w0zQ,epAhbTwnVNXqFKwHDlgpBQ,_8RwgNjUPTQlr3_TKCd9vQ,5,2,0,0,"It can be difficult as a bride to find the ""one and only"" tailor right for you and the one dress you have. I noted the questions tailors I reached out to would ask, their price quotes, and recommendations. Linda left a positive impression with her prompt responses and honest input. Because Linda works from her house rather than at a facility where additional charges are incurred, she was also more affordable.

EXPERIENCE:
While I had these thoughts going in, Linda continued to surprise me. It was apparent that Linda was experienced and knew what was important. She asked me to bring my wedding shoes and encouraged me to sit, walk around, and move with the dress to make sure that where the dress hit would work for the day of during our second fitting. She also made adjustments as we went, requiring additional work on her end to make things just right.

CHANGES:
Linda was extremely detailed in explaining the changes that would be required with the dress; I had bought the dress one size too large (I just listened to what the wedding shop said). In addition to the mandatory shortening of the dress, she had to trim pieces of the top so that it didn't hit my neck awkwardly. She also brought in the back of the dress. All of this required removal and readdition of the lace afterwards. Linda helped to add cups with the dress and also bustled it, which I was told later can be a challenge with the layers of tulle. 

Linda was someone I could consult my ideas with and will not say ""yes"" to everything a bride wants. I liked this about her, because I asked for more poof to my dress, and she advised against it, explaining how the material of tulle with other material used to add poof could take away from the flow and delicacy of the dress. She was open to doing it if I wanted to, but her reasoning made me drop the idea, and I am glad I did.

CHANGES / BUSTLE:
I didn't realize Linda would end up adding clear buttons for the bustle. It threw me off to see them on my dress, and I admittedly became the stereotypical over-worried bride. I am happy to say that the Xpert knew what she was doing- it wasn't visible in any of the wedding pictures and I almost forgot I had worried unnecessarily about it. For brides who do want to be informed throughout the process I would advise asking to make sure expectations are in alignment. To emphasize, there was nothing negative about my experience, but knowing how brides can get, I'm just adding this as something to consider :)

The bustle was a little harder for my bridesmaids to do, likely due to the tulle material. Linda drew a diagram for my bridesmaids to follow and let me record her explaining how to do the bustle. She also advised that my bridesmaids practice the day before. Unfortunately, I wasn't insistent on this with my bridesmaids, who said it looked straightforward enough, so we ended up spending nearly an hour getting the bustle and were late to the reception (something for others to think about for their day of!)

COST:
Knowing the cost of tailoring my friends had gone through, the quoted price was much better than I was expecting, provided all of the changes. Linda was very transparent with the work she needed to complete, and the time that it would take given the changes. For brides with a budget, I would recommend going in with a set amount and idea, but knowing that if there are additional changes that you hadn't thought of, be flexible and understanding that something may need to give (perhaps not all of the recommended alterations can be done, for example). I felt it was reasonable and that Linda's expertise was certainly worth it.

COMMUNICATION / SCHEDULING:
When working with Linda, be sure to be clear of the dates and timelines. I erroneously thought we had a meeting a different day because she had suggested meeting in 3 weeks, and I may have accidentally marked a date, but didn't confirm this with her. Linda is very responsive through text, so there will not be a problem with going back and forth to plan logistics. It was also a plus that she was flexible and had later hours and weekends available.

TIMELINE:
Everyone's experience will be different; I ended up having 3 total trips.
- June 19: First trip for estimate and review of needed changes
- July 14: Second dress fitting; additional modifications to planned changes based on progress thus far
- July 20: Dress completed
- August 3: Dress picked up, bustling instructions shared

Linda treats you like a sister by the end of the journey. She is truly talented, and an artist in her own right, expressed through the beauty of her completed dresses.

The last thing you want is to worry about is your wedding dress not fitting right the day of, where thousands of dollars are already spent. With Linda, my dress looked beautiful the day of. I was comfortable and able to dance the night away with ease; my dress did not get caught once, even as I danced to Gangnam Style.

I loved this place so much, that I returned...twice more over the weekend in search of things that I very, very needed after a 3 week vacation abroad (cleaning supplies, etc.) and I love it.

I decided to try their balsamic glazed chicken with mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables.

I could not finish my meal because of the overbearing amount of the glaze on my plate. The mashed potato on the side tasted a lot better than anything and I would have preferred having that as my main to be honest. Tip: ask for the sauce to be on the side. 

Others at the table had the salmon entree and a steak with chipotle shrimp. Both really enjoyed their food and finished their meals. Hence 2 out of the 5 stars.

Normally Poulet Bronze is my go to place for late night fried chicken. $2.25/piece for a very spicy and crispy coating is nothing to sneeze at, especially when it is delivered to your door after 11 pm.

However, last night they screwed up right royally and I am questioning my need for fried chicken in a city that knows how to do steak tartare, foie gras croissants better than anyplace else this (or that) side of the Mississippi...

In short, half the order was forgotten. No one said ""sorry."" When I asked to speak to the manager, I was told he wasn't in. When I asked that the manager call me, I was told he would, but he didn't. And then on top of it the delivery guy/driver yelled at me when he returned (an hour later) with the forgotten half, because he had not been trained properly to check that he was taking everything on that was written on the bill.

They opened a second location in ville Saint Laurent, and the more I think about it, the more convinced I become that like East Side Mario's, Madison's Barr + Grill, and other wannabe American restaurants they belong there and not downtown in Montreal.

Perhaps, if I am racked up in a hospital and unable to do anything other than blink my eyes in order to communicate, I might reconsider ordering from them, but only because Poulet Bronze is 12 letters long and Dinette Triple Crown is 18 letters long. But ultimately I think it comes down to a question of respect. And nothing shows how much a restaurant respects a client as when the delivery guy yells at you in the hall and the manager can't even be bothered to say ""I'm sorry.""

And finally, as I alluded to earlier, there is so much good food that is native to Montreal, I'm not quite convinced anymore for the need to deal with what could only be considered average food imported from elsewhere.",335,9/16/2013 23:04,FALSE,0.141651307

With the first snowy and blustery weather of the season, I thought a salad and pizza was in order.  I ended up revisiting a former friend - Roman Fountain.

We did a chicken caesar salad and a pizza with pepperoni, mushrooms, green peppers and extra sauce.  Overall, I was very impressed with both the salad and the pizza.  It was very enjoyable and I would recommend them to others.

Note: the chicken in the caesar is kept in a separate container.  The dressing was very good.

The pizza was picture perfect.  Golden crust in a typical Cleveland-style (not thin, nor clearly not deep dish).  My only comment - they hover on that ""slightly skimpy"" range of toppings.  It was enough to qualify as adequate, however it is sitting at that low range.

Extra sauce is a necessity.  Their sauce is very flavorful and quite thick so extra sauce still soaks in well.  To give you an idea, there was still no sauce dripping off the pizza.

Like I said, a perfectly fine job.  The order was taken correctly and it was ready when promised.

Another point worth making, their pricing is reasonable compared to some of their competition. I'm sure being take-out or delivery only and being in business sine the mid-50's allows more favorable pricing.

I've heard and read mixed reviews about this place, but I decided to give it shot anyway (I normally don't go to new places with mixed reviews). There were a lot of stuff on the menu, probably close to 100 wing sauces that can satisfy every palate. The boyfriend and I went for the sample platter (20 pieces + veggie sticks = $24.99) because we're very indecisive (or greedy? ha!) couple. We went for the safe Hot Honey (my favorite kind at St. Louis), and tried 3 new flavors: Desperado (Buffalo Medium & Maple), Farmer's Daughter (BBQ, Medium, Wild Jerk), and Gar Par (Caesar & Parmesan). 

1. Hot Honey - more like Buffalo and Honey, which is not a big stretch from the Desperado. Was quite disappointed but edible nonetheless.

2. Desperado - couldn't taste the Maple. Pure Buffalo imo.

3. Farmer's Daugther - I think this is a confusing mix. Buffalo and Wild Jerk are strong flavors, so they don't mix well together (no dominant flavor). The boyfriend hated the smell of this one, so I ended up finishing this batch :p

4. Gar Par - it's like eating regular wings with caesar salad dressing. If that's your cup of tea, then go for it. I found it odd and too creamy for my taste buds.

Unlike St. Louis, the wing order doesn't come with fries. We had to order a side of fries. We ordered the Naked Fries ($4.99) and they came out like McCain's fries. DISAPPOINTING.

And don't worry about the heat level. The 4-flame one didn't hurt my tongue at all.

Our tab came out to be $36 (incl. tip and we didn't order drinks). I say it's quite pricey. On top of that, I got a serious case of stomachache right after lunch.

I prefer their Avenue Rd & Lawrence location just because it's bigger, I can see the wood fire oven better & get parking more easily.  Otherwise, I would have given this 5 stars.

PARKING
Metered parking can be a nightmare at this Bayview location.  

Located on the west side of Bayview, but close enough to Millwood lights to the south that you can park on either side.

FOOD
They sell Western brand cream cheese to go or you can choose from around a dozen really interesting, traditional and non-traditional flavours of cream cheese they blend.  It's cute because they decorate the top of each flavour.

They have a phyllo ""spinach feta spiral"" that is garlicky and tasty.  It is better if it is warmed up, which they offer to do.

They sell a few flavours of rugelach, but I haven't had them.

Their bagel flavours are pretty traditional: cinnamon-raisin, poppy, sesame, everything.  They have a wonderful chew.  They are not the massive oversized bagels.  I wish they had a sprinkling of salt for their seed options to compensate for the lack of salt that is in traditional Montreal bagel dough, but I still enjoy them immensely anyways.

I love that they never seem to run out of flavours.  I'm guessing they bake bagels all day/night like the Avenue Rd location???

DRINKS
They have some bottled brand name smoothies and juices.

SEATING
Next to none.  Maybe 3 seats if I am recalling correctly.

STAFF
Prompt and friendly.  Though hard to see staff over the tall display cases; I use my imagination and envision a giant claw machine at the arcade that fetches a plush toy after I put in a Loonie then they appear at the cash register with my haul.

Pros:
- The pasta was a hearty portion
- The dishes tasted nice
- The assistants were very nice
- The chef was very nice
- Facilities were clean and the assistants were constantly cleaning up after us

Cons:
- The entire experience felt disorganized from start to finish
- The chef seemed incredibly uncomfortable with public speaking and often receded into himself during instruction. There were times where he would be in the middle of an explanation, struggle to find the words, and then just stop talking and perform the task hoping that others would understand by watching
- The recipes were different from what was promoted on the website which was a great disappointment to the group I attended the session with
- From the beginning the chef said that we were making ravioli, and told us to roll the dough out to ravioli size. Then halfway through the class (after the dough was already rolled out) he  corrected himself by saying ""oh actually we are making raviolo"". This caused many people to struggle since they did not roll their dough out to the correct width.
- Promotion of items in store was annoying. I don't want to listen to a 5 minute spiel about useless gadgets...teach me how to cook.
- The chef was reading the recipes from a paper....and sounded surprised to learn what we were making. 
- Lack of information about dough making. He would just say things like ""we are using 00 flour"" without any elaboration on that. 

Overall: I expected Sur la Table to have a higher standard for the chefs they would get to teach. I am disappointed that my husband and I spend $140 and didn't take away much from the lesson",312,6/3/2016 19:18,FALSE,0.086391152

They also happen to be pretty healthy choices which I should point out for those of you that like your grease and carbs of plenty. They have about a dozen different types of salads which you choose how many scoops of each you want. Then you can add protein to it in the form of grilled chicken, ahi tuna and so on. Everything looks very fresh and as though it was just made. It looks that way when I have been there I should say. 

They also offer three flavors of lemonade. I always get blueberry mint. It comes with fresh mint leaves and is always very cold which I love. I have favorites when it comes to the salads. The edamame and tuna salad and the squash and kale are my favorites. I've tried three other kinds of salads and they weren't bad they just weren't my thing. The salads tend to be a little bland; I think they either under season them or don't put any sea salt in them. 

Now you might be confused with how often I've been here and how I really enjoy the drink and salads I always get as to why I would give them only three stars. There is one specific employee or manager there that I find really rude every time he's there. The rest of the employees are very friendly and nice to talk too. They all have a really, really hard time with the scoop system that they use. You have to choose how many scoops of each salad you want and they have different scoop sized dishes. Every time I go it's different. I'll tell them I would like two scoop of each salad. It should be up to them to ask if the salads should all be in the same container or separate containers. Half the time they get out a huge container and start putting my salads in the same container without asking. Then I feel horrible but I have to have them separate because it usually takes me a few days to eat it and I don't like my flavors mixed. This seems to cause a huge confusion and they somehow can't add two and two anymore and I'll end up with one scoop of the first salad and three of the other or four of each and because of the way I am I just take it. I know two plus two is not difficult and at the beginning I say I would like two scoops of each salad so I know it's not my fault. It wouldn't be that big of a deal if it didn't happen every single time and if I didn't see it happen with other people. Plus this place is very expensive. Each scoop will cost you $3.50 and that adds up fast as the scoops are small. 

The biggest and I believe extremely important complaint I have that in the end may cause me to stop going is the lack of work hygiene. Even subway puts on gloves just to scoop out soup into the soup cups. At dirtbelly I have never seen an employee wash their hands or put on gloves. They don't wear hairnets or at least hats with ponytails. I'm guessing they would argue it's because they don't touch any food but that's wrong. I've seen them touch the inside of the salad containers when they pick them up with their hands, touch the part of the lids that touch the food, they make your lemonade with their hands and the last time I went the man at the till stuck his entire bare hand inside the little bag he used tongs to put my coconut balls into. He handled money, credit cards, touched his face, the counter and God know what else and the stuck his hands inside the bag my food touched bare. I have been sick for almost ten years now with kidney and immune problems so stuff like that can be really dangerous to me. I was afraid to say anything because of the rude employee I mentioned from before so I paid for and took something that could kill me. I'm not exaggerating by the way. A regular persons hands can carry MERSA which can kill anyone on top of other things that would make me very ill. The answer to this complaint should not be for me to stop eating there because these things don't meet food and safety regulations for everyone. It should be them that changes. If they made a person ill or killed a person it could end their business let alone how horrible it would be for that to happen. 

I would love to have written a long review on how amazing the food is here and hopefully one day I can. The health issues and inability to work their own scoop system has to be dealt with though.",844,4/2/2016 14:23,TRUE,0.182227563

Richard's team installed new floors in the kitchen and bath, new countertops, backsplash, lights, etc. Fortunately, Richard's team suspected a leak when doing the floors and was able to repair. During that time, Las Vegas had experienced rain and a leak in the roof was also discovered and thanks to Richard it was repaired.

You can get your ice cream by the cone or dish, or packed to go by the pint or 1/2 gallon. 

I had the opportunity to work at Country Maid in the mid-1980s and was able to watch the ice cream making process, which is done in-house. It's all done with real milk, natural flavorings, and lots of care. And we were always big on cleanliness -- everything was scrubbed multiple times a day. You can enjoy your ice cream, sundae, or milkshake (made with the old fashioned way) inside or out on the deck.

They've expanded quite a bit since my time in the 80's, but the same family still owns and manages the business -- so the same care and attention to detail is there. Also here is fresh fruit (apples, blueberries, raspberries, plums, pears, and cherries) and vegetables (peppers, tomatoes, etc.) for sale at the building behind and to the left of the ice cream store. 

Working there, I got the chance to taste everything. There really isn't a bad flavor. My personal favorite flavors would be penuchi fudge (caramel), chocolate chip, or black walnut.

Bowtie pasta - I like the nutty flavour of this dish and quite light! It is quite good

Pulled pork sandwich had no - NONE - smoked flavor.  My 24 year old son said it was like someone found some meat and threw a little BBQ sauce on it.  His words:  WORST BBQ I'VE EVER EATEN.

Husband has the same dinner - said it was flavorless.

My full rib dinner - well the biggest potato I think I've ever seen.  Asked for more butter & sour cream which never came.  Girl did offer more ice tea several times.  I think It was the water - it did not taste right.  It wasn't bad - on its way out - but was not right.  Am not sure what was wrong with it.

The ribs - the meaty part of the bone was tough and did not ""fall off the bone""  you tugged to get  it.  Burned top - seemed like they were cooked and BBQ and ready to serve and then through back k on the grill to warm with more sauce. 

Meal was rushed - sat down; got the tea, served my salad and before I was 1/3 of the way done with the salad the meal was served.

I did not say anything that night, Saturday 7 April, 2018 because my son does not like that I do.  I have to inform you - perhaps you don't know what's going on in the kitchen.  

My son won't go back.  He said after paying over $60.00 to take us to BBQ - he could have stood in the yard and just burned the money.  Same effect.

I throughly enjoyed every single dish. The butternut squash ravioli was on the sweet side but it mixed really well with the brown butter and walnuts. The ricotta cheese and mushrooms was light and fluffy, but not too heavy. The ink squid pasta was good, but can be an acquired taste because of the momba hot sauce. 

The hanger steak and rapini was delicious and cooked via sous-vide to perfection. The sea bream was good as well - and the pea purée was the really winner because the fish had a very clean taste.

The service was really good and attentive. The chefs explained each dish in detail and how they prepared it, which elevated the experience even more.

I've been to this restaurant before, just never reviewed it. My previous trips were fabulous and on point. As soon as you set foot in the door, you are enrobed in the glorious aroma of  BBQ smoked meaty goodness. You can smell it blocks away. It even makes this vegetarian salivate! 

Maybe it was the sign outside the door that said ""Cook Wanted"" that should have raised the red flags. But, hunger always wins and on our way inside my husband and I went. 

We were seated promptly, though it took awhile to even get a drink. Our salad and appetizer of BBQ brisket flatbread came out about 15 minutes later. It was tasty but undercooked. After about 20 minutes into putting our order in for the BBQ brisket dinner and a mashed potato pizza, we were informed that the pizza oven wasn't working. It was taking a long time because it had to be made in the regular oven. A solid 35 minutes into waiting and then watching the people who came in after us get served before us, my patience was nil. 

The pizza finally arrived, at the 40 minute mark. Of course it was a soggy mess. The brisket dinner was room temperature, with hot beans for good measure. I sent the pizza right back, only to be told that ""the pizza oven was now working"". The waitress really could have kept that fact to herself at that point. Sorry your kitchen staff can't get it together. We promptly packed up our food and left. The pizza was taken off the bill, but nothing else was comped in any way. 

Now, I could have stuck around and raised a big stink, got the manager involved, blah, blah. But honey, after the crap shoot of a day I had, I just didn't have the energy to feed more vampires. All I wanted to do was go home. 

So, in conclusion, Smoke really, truly does have amazing BBQ foods. They are worth checking out. I'll give them another chance somewhere down the distant road. And I'll be sure to ask if their pizza oven is working before I order.",402,5/25/2018 2:55,TRUE,0.08092967

Rent is overpriced for such a crappy complex, and you pay water, sewer, trash and pest control btw. Didn't know this until the lease signing. They have a lot of ridiculous fees too and there's mild extortion involved in the whole beginning process.  

Walls are paper thin and neighbors are exceptionally loud. Here's what we hear 24 hours, 7 days a week:

The entire day, small children are screaming, banging on your walls, stomping around, jumping off furniture, aggressively throwing around toys, etc. Our apartment is constantly shaking. Other neighbors have guests at all hours of the night. We hear, not a simple knock, but aggressive banging on doors periodically throughout the night until early morning. We're assuming there are drug deals going on. People are constantly banging things around over there throughout the entire night as well. Just the other day, our neighbor thought that it was a good idea to vacuum at 4 in the morning. On top of this, there are dozens of teenagers running around at all hours of the night, screaming, hooting, hollering, laughing, and banging on the stair rails so that our entire apartment shakes. In the cooler season, when you keep your windows open, you get to hear the neighbor's conversations outside, which always consists of 'getting high' or 'drug deals gone wrong'. Occasionally/about once a month so far, people will scream aggressively at each other for hours and slam doors. Recently there were several women screaming at each other outside in the courtyard at 4 in the morning. This lasted about an hour. Just the other day, a couple were fighting, and the screams were terrifying. I have never heard people scream like that at people they love. Every day and night there is some new thing. 

That's the biggest issue so far. Other issues are security being totally useless. Just some guy walking around on his phone. There have been dozens of people screaming outside at 2 in the morning, and he has done nothing to stop it. Safety is an issue. I have seen drug deals in the parking lot. People sit in their cars, on their phones, acting shady as well. There are some pretty low people living here, and it's hard to believe that management is oblivious to this. Just, don't live here if you're a good person. Find somewhere better. It doesn't matter if you work days, evenings, or grave. . . you will never sleep here.

Given that, while visiting my sister, she insisted that I go to Morgan's, her magical shoe store. The husband and I browsed for a few minutes before someone offered to help us. He measured my feet, offered me water, and went to the back to get some shoes. So far, so good.

Now one of my issues with shoe shopping is that I can usually tell, within seconds of putting a shoe on, that it absolutely Will. Not. Work. I have bought many shoes in my life optimistically saying, ""They'll break in! It'll be fine!"" Spoiler alert -- they do not break in, and it is not fine. This generally leads me to rapid-fire try on every shoe available in my size in the store, in the hopes of finding something that fits.

In a setting like Morgan's, then, where they bring out a few pairs at a time, things get tedious and annoying very quickly for everyone involved. I promise I am not trying to be a pain...but I am NOT getting talked into a pair of expensive, unattractive shoes that aren't a PERFECT fit. And if I put a shoe on and it immediately hurts some part of my foot, I am done with those shoes. There is no point in spending 15 minutes playing with tiny adjustments; it is a lost cause and I abandon it.

So what happened at Morgan's is what always happens. I tried on a few pairs that were moderately attractive and not moderately-priced, refused to try on a few pairs that positively screamed ""Grandma orthopedic shoes,"" got talked into trying on a few pairs by my companions (that I knew wouldn't fit or I wouldn't like, and yup, they/I didn't), and ultimately didn't find anything remotely plausible. The salesman was pleasant and helpful, but he couldn't really do much with the available options.

That said, they had several styles of posture-correcting seats out in the open to try, and I did find a nice one for working at my desk. I was even able to use my 10% off coupon.

Overall, if you are somewhat sensitive to how your shoes look as well as how they feel, or if you find you run out of options quickly, Morgan's may not be the magical solution for you. Aside from continually cringing at style and price, I don't have any real problems with the experience, but I didn't find anything even remotely promising, so I wouldn't bother going back.",449,8/24/2018 22:33,TRUE,0.117265914

Full rack ribs - 5 stars - for only around $20, the ribs were tender and fell off the bone. It is made to order on a fire grill, and came with deliciously seasoned rice and salad.

Half a chicken - 4 stars - for $9, hubby said we should have gotten the whole chicken for only $6 more because he loved the roasted  flavor mixed with their piri piri sauce, which i can't describe, but a half chicken with the other dishes we ordered were enough.

Ultime poutine - 4 stars - for $12, we got a large dish of fries, potato, meat cheese curds mixed in a wine flavored sauce that tasted unique.

Flan - 3 1/2 star - for $3, the flan tasted sweet and was enough for 2 since we had a filling dinner.

Service - 3 1/2 stars - the menu board was in french so we had a hard time ordering, but the man at the counter spoke English. He could have at least told us there was an English take out menu so we could see the different items easier. The female cashier was courteous.",253,6/19/2018 4:18,TRUE,0.108309931

We stumbled across the postings for this place, and as we had never had Yemeni food before, we thought that it would be ideal.  YS Restaurant is located on the Northeast corner of Rural Road and University Drive in Tempe, Arizona, right near Arizona State University.  There is a parking lot on that corner behind the buildings that line the intersection of Rural and University that abuts the restaurant entrance.

Having read the previous Yelp reviews, we knew the drill for this establishment.  On our way in, we snagged menus off the counter before seating ourselves at a booth.  There was an area in the front of the restaurant where one could sit on the floor on cushions in the traditional Arab-style, but we really didn't feel like being that authentic.  Drinks were in two refrigerated cabinets, and I walked over and picked out soft drinks for the two of us.

When the very nice and helpful young lady who was behind the counter came over to take our order, we were ready.  She asked if we had any questions about the food, but we had already made up our minds.  Mom decided to have the Lamb Shank, and I went for the Goat Meat.  The entrees were ready very quickly, and she brought them right out to us.

Goat is a rich and slightly unctuous meat, a bit like Oxtail, with bones like the latter for which one has to watch out.  Here it is served on a generous bed of Yemeni-seasoned Basmati rice with two sauces, an Arab form of Tzatziki and a chili-spiced hot sauce.  It flavour was simply delicious.  Mom was equally pleased with her Lamb Shank.  It was falling-off the bone, and she noted that it was some of the tenderest lamb that she had ever tasted.  When we talked to the young woman again after the meal, when she was, also, kind enough to snap a photo of both of us, she told us that the lamb was cooked for three to four hours and that some of the spices for the rice were imported all the way from Yemen itself.

All in all, our first experience with Yemeni food was a great one.  This feeling seems to have been shared with the Middle Easterners who were eating there, too, who appeared to be enjoying their meals whilst dining in the Arab manner.  We were especially pleased that the proportions of the delicious rice and the meat were enough to merit bringing some home in a doggie-box in order that we could have another meal later.  If you live or are visiting up in the Phoenix area, YS Restaurant is definitely worth a visit.",484,5/17/2018 8:07,FALSE,0.102006484

W4ENl-H07HTA5Xk0N4G1cg,7mXxIhdR31BRo5BJcyx0sg,_CgyqbB7ySSZrCi3c8toLQ,1,0,0,0,"Holt Renfrew Yorkdale has got to be THE WORST store for customer service and consistency.... Most times one goes and is rewarded with poor customer service, on the odd occasion, the service is impressive. It depends on the department you are shopping in. You can expect THE WORST from the shoe department. Where do I begin with my lament?
1) They are short staffed 5 days before a sale is about to start, who cares right? 
I do, you see, the sales associates call all their regular customers to come in and pre-buy the stock that is going on sale.( Please keep in mind that these are people that buy 2-3 pairs of shoes of $1000 + or more per pair at a time, as if they are buying a package of gum.) This is to ensure that the customer gets the shoe and size of their choice and the sale price to boot, before the actual sale, by using a very convoluted system that they have devised.
So why would a sales person want to serve me, and help me buy 1 pair of $1000+ shoes at regular price? IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COMMISSION!!

2) On my most recent foray into the shoe department of Holt Renfrew Yorkdale, I had a hard time trying to get a sales person to help my daughter and I , but I managed to find one, who would give us the time of day and help us.
The shoes that we came to buy were out of stock in my daughter's size, BUT we were told that we could pre-pay for the shoes and they would be in store for pick up within a week. That was on May 22, 2016. He even gave my daughter his cell phone number so that she could text him for ""updates"" These shoes were a well deserved birthday gift to my daughter from SEVERAL family members. She was excited and thrilled at the prospect of getting the shoes. I on the other hand was very nervous that she would not get the shoes, as you see IT'S ALL ABOUT THE COMMISSION!! None the less, we bought the shoes. Our transaction took a total of 15 minutes from start to end. Meanwhile, there were people, monopolizing a sales person from before we got there, during a wait for a sales person, and during our transaction, we left, while they were still trying on shoes and ""making a decision."" By my estimates that would be about 45 minutes of time being used WITHOUT A SALE, versus my 15 WITH A SALE.

3) Commission trick #2, sales person pre-sells a customer shoes for pick up in store, BUT when someone comes into the store on the day that the shoes have arrived, with cash in hand, willing to buy the same style of shoes, if the only size in the store that are available, are YOUR PREPAID SHOES, guess what? YOUR PREPAID SHOES get sold to that person, who NEVER HAD TO PREPAY OR WAIT. When you contact them to find out what is taking so long to get your shoes, you get  told a ""story"" about why your shoes are delayed.

4) Story #1---My daughter was told that her shoes had come in,  BUT! the wrong colour was in the box!! REALLY??? Give me a break. But in another 5 days, her shoes would come in (hmmm....probably sold her pair to someone else and re-ordered her size in again) Or she could buy the colour that came in??? Go ----yourself. No, she wanted what she originally PREPAID FOR

5) Story #2---That particular style is sold out company wide. It is a very popular shoe. The manager will talk to you about it.

6) Story #3--- Manager says, You can wait up to 3 weeks for the shoe and size to come in, or you can get a refund.  But, if you get a refund and re-purchase, then a $100 coupon that was used at the time becomes null and void and you can't use it toward the re-purchase of the shoes. When asked how a shoe could be in stock on day of purchase and PRE-PAYMENT and then suddenly out of stock,  my daughter was told that someone put the wrong colour shoes in the box that was sent to the YORKDALE store. (Don't BELIEVE a single word that you say). That would mean that at time of purchase there was only 1 pair of shoes in my daughter's size available company wide. If that was the case, we should have been informed as such. BUT I DON'T BELIEVE that was the case. 

My daughter opted to wait for the shoes in her size to come in. She has been texting the salesperson who sold her the shoes regularly for ""updates"" but what a surprise, he has stopped responding......

 Hmmm....the COMMISSSION plot continues....

Do yourself a favour, walk right by the shoe department in HOLT RENFREW YORKDALE, go elsewhere to buy your shoes, buy online if you have to! WE ARE NEVER GOING BACK THERE AGAIN!!! I'll pay more, if I have to, but I'll go where I'm treated better than here, and there are no COMMISSION GAMES being played.

As it stands, we are going to get a refund and get our shoes from Saks... so sorry. We are Canadian, and want to support a Canadian company. Why does it have to be so hard?",908,6/8/2016 13:25,FALSE,0.099974815

Once we went in to where they put the actual print on the shirt the sales guy put the shirt in the presser thing, THEN he asked if I wanted to add a ""protective coating"" for an extra $5, which I agreed to. A girl rang it up and asked if I wanted the receipt and I said ""that's ok"" (so I didn't see what she rang me up for). Well I checked my account today and saw a charge for $70.36! I thought it was a simple mistake until I called the guy who answered the phone # I found online for this ""Custom Kings"" charge on my account, and the guy told me I didn't understand the charge, and that the t-shirt is $19.99 but the PRINT was extra. So I asked him if he was trying to tell me that the tank top costs $70, and he wouldn't answer me, and proceeded to argue w/me, insult me, & I then told him I was going to report him to the BBB and tell all my friends to never buy anything from these incredulous deceitful people.

Upon entering aromas of sweet milk chocolate began filling your senses. At 6pm on a Saturday evening it was starting to get quite busy. There is a case of handmade chocolate truffles and off in the distance I see the chocolate dipping station and a soft serve machine. They also offer tons of packaged chocolates, canned fondues, chocolate lollipops, and some cooking utensils.
For those who are unfamiliar with this Quebec based chain it is an artisinal chocolate shop whose speciality is selling soft serve ice cream that is hand dipped in 1 of 12 real chocolate flavoured dips. They also have milkshakes, gourmet hot chocolates, and soft serve icecream on a waffle or brownie.
Although we had already had a huge dinner and dessert how could I turn down trying that famous dipped ice cream. They have quite a bit of seating here if you want to stay and enjoy your dessert however we got everything to go. They offer a variety of sizes but I went with the smallest size called ""baby"". They had only 2 flavours of soft serve that night vanilla and orange so I got a vanilla dipped in dark chocolate.
The baby size was actually a perfect amount for me considering I just wanted a little something. The soft serve itself isn't anything to write home about just your typical vanilla. However the real highlight here was the quality of the dip. The chocolate used was delicious! The dip was quite thick and rich and for dark chocolate it was on the sweeter side almost more semi sweet tasting to me. However the coating was really hard and I had a tough time biting through it. I was glad I asked for in a cup because If I was biting a cone I could see it shattering everywhere however I still had a heck of time cracking through the chocolate coating to get to the ice cream especially with my plastic spoon. The chocolate also solidified to the cup and although it was mighty tasty I hard time chiseling it off the cup.
Hubby got a small Strawberry Shortcake Milkshake. He said it was good but he wasn't wowed by it.
Overall I have to say there chocolate is on point. It's an interesting concept of a shop and something different to have around. I'll be back to try out some of there chocolates and if the craving hits again I wouldn't mind to try a different flavoured dip soft serve or perhaps the brownie or waffle topped ice cream.",458,2/18/2018 2:44,TRUE,1

There are a lot of great things about Springhill.  It has a convenient location, plenty of parking and modern rooms.  

I was very pleased with every step of our experience.  I called to get the room (so I could ensure room for the pack n plays) and the employee was very friendly.  She even checked various items (military status, aaa member etc) to get us the best rate.  Check in was quick and easy.  Our room was clean and well equipped.  In fact, there were bottles of baby shampoo on the counter with the other shampoos because they had noted the babies on our reservation.

Staff was friendly and accommodating. Extra towels were delivered quickly and every employee I encountered smiled and said hi.

Beds were comfortable and clean.  I slept on the pull out and was pleasantly surprised that it was even comfortable.

Breakfast was a nice feature.  There was a nice selection of both cold and hot selections. Dry cereal, bagels, bread and croissants along with yogurt.  Hot options included ham, sausage and scrambled eggs.  The breakfast staff was helpful pointing out a large table in the back that worked well for families.

We didn't use it, but there is a pool in the hotel as well.  

The one downside is that many of the rooms have a view of the turnpike toll gate.  The rooms must be well insulated because you heat very little noise from it.

I love how Tempe is growing to be a community of different backgrounds and cultures, and no greater manifestation of this can be shown by the food that is offered here. I had never had cuisine from Yemen before so I was excited to go on a food journey and try some dishes. The restaurant itself is very nondescript and the overhead signage simply says ""Restaurant"". The name of the restaurant is plastered on the front glass walls and on a sidewalk sign though. 

The interior is similarly nondescript, with tables and booths in the front although there does look to be a nice area in the back where people can sit on cushions and eat on a low table. The menu offers various Middle Eastern dishes you will find at other restaurants such as falafel and shawarma but also has a few unique offerings you won't find elsewhere in Tempe. After finding out that  fahsa/salteh (Lamb stew) was the national dish of Yemen, I knew I needed to try it out!

It arrived scorchingly​ hot, so I needed to wait a bit for it to cool down before trying any. I ended up trying a few bites of falafel, hummus and rice from my husband's plate while I waited. I found the to be hummus smooth and creamy, the falafel crisp on the outside with a good texture and flavor on the inside, and the rice to be soft and well seasoned. The stew was so good; I can see why it would be called the national dish! It was bold and spicy, yet had a comforting homey feel to it from the slow cooked, soft lamb to the thick rustic broth. It was served with some pieces of pita. 

Note that they don't seem to offer any glasses of water. All the water is by the bottle in 2 drink cases to each side of the counter. There is also a selection of American and Middle Eastern sodas to choose from. When I asked if they offered cups of water the cashier said they did but when the server dropped off our food and I asked for a cup of water he brought me a bottle of water. 

Our server also neglected to give us any silverware for our meal which I had to remind him to provide to us. Service in general was genial though and we were checked up on as needed.

It's the views of Old Montreal and the Vieux-Port from the church tower make it worth the trek to this part of Old Montreal.  The small museum is located in the crypt of the church and has an adjacent associated archeological site that you can also tour.

The chapel is thankfully free, but there is an $8 admission fee for the museum (it's steep considering all you get is the museum and tower access for the views).

I started riding at a horse barn in Waxhaw but would visit the ASC Greenway stables for summer camps. Shortly after a few summers, I was teaching and working as a camp counselor.

With over 2000 acres of wood land, there are plenty of places to explore. Around 14 miles of horse trails and more than 20 miles of beautiful hiking trails, too. Just a great spot to get outside and away from our technologically driven society. 

There is a great hiking loop around Lake Haigler for any and all experience levels. Around 1.2 miles for the full lap and a perfect view of colorful leaves in the fall. 

Should you get a moment to stop by the stables, there are 80 or so horses (some boarded and others owned by the barn) to pet and chuckle at. Some of them have quite the personality when they see a sweet child admiring their large size and fluffy winter fur. 

The Greenway offers lots of great events like the Fiddle n' Pig Shindig, which is a BBQ contest and festival in the fall. The Summer Concert Series runs June through August and while it's very hot out, the Comporium Amphitheater is at the bottom of a small hill and under several large trees to shade its audience.

During the comprehensive eye examination, I got my pupils dilated. Be sure to bring a pair of sunglasses with you if you're driving - you will be sensitive to lights! Or you can purchase a fashionable pair in their dispensary. The clinic carries a great selection of brand name eyewear and sunglasses!

We also did something called Optomap wide-field retinal scan, which carefully and thoroughly checks the inside of the eye for any hidden eye diseases, monitors suspicious areas and changes from year to year, and confirms that everything is healthy!

During the visit, I also learned that Dr. Tang specializes in contact lens wear, LASIK consultation, and Ortho-K (AOK) overnight corrective contact lens for myopia control in children. You can also make an appointment online anytime using their real-time schedule - very convenient and easy to use.

Andy who helped me sign my lease is very personable and friendly. This apartment complex is great because it's right next door to a very large park and still very secluded. Whenever I'd ask for a work order, it would be completed the next day! Ricardo the maintenance man is awesome!!!! He works very hard for the renters needs maintaining and fixing anything that needs up keep. The rent at Sedona is very reasonable and well worth it!!! I did have some loud neighbors on one side of the apartment that also smoked a lot of marijuana but unfortunately we can't pick our neighbors. The pool is sometimes dirty, but again thats because of people who don't know how to clean up after themselves. There are pros and cons wherever you decide to rent but overall I would recommend this apartment to anyone!!!! 
****The only downfall to this company is when I terminated my year lease I was stiffed with a large bill that was sent to my new address: carpet cleaning $85, general cleaning $90, light paint $35, spray counter tops $250. I understand the general cleaning of carpets is necessary but if I knew I would being charged a $90 cleaning fee I wouldn't have cleaned it as good as I did! The apartment was very clean when I left and took pictures to prove it!!!! I tried to dispute some of the claims and they didn't have any of it. Anyways, all I'm trying to say for future renters is when your lease is due you probably will have a fee of $250 and up for general cleaning, shampoo carpet, and touch up paint. I just wished I was given a heads up for these fees or an estimate at the time of signing my contract so I wouldn't be so surprised while opening my mail! My bill was just shy of $400!!!! Plus they didn't even do a walk through when my lease was up!!!!! I called them and asked and they said no walk though needed and to just drop off the keys at thefront desk. If they did a walk through in the beginning of the lease then why not do one at the end of the lease? I just thought that was really dumb. I just feel like I didn't deserved to pay that amount.

After chatting briefly with the store manager about pies in Calgary and elsewhere, I chose the raspberry/blueberry combo for take-out. Once home with my favorite coffee, heated up a piece, added some quality French vanilla ice-cream, and presto, good afternoon treats!

At first blush, the berries tasted fairly fresh and vibrant, and the flaky crust spoke of butter, and a certain baking finesse that sets good pies apart from poor to bad.

The downsides?
Underlying flavour.
After eating a second piece on the following day, it became apparent that the flavour is somehow dampened, and not nearly as good as they could be. Why does it seem so hard to make a truly outstanding fruit pie commercially? I don't know, but, as is exemplified at Simple Simon Pies, the tongue knows stuff that the bakers may miss or try to conceal. Trust it more. 

Price! 
Striking the balance between the three core elements - quality, quantity, price - for any product or service is dicey, but these pies are far too small for the price charged! 

On both of the above counts, in another city, many times we enjoyed delicious multi-berry pies that were twice the size and weight for almost half the price ($14): among these 3 factors, they had attained the balance wonderfully well, and their pies literally flew off the shelves. Often by mid-morning at both sites in the city, their daily run was sold out!
But at Pie Junkie? 
Ah, but $26 for a small pie both in diameter and filling just doesn't cut it! Nor do the flavours compete favorably with the other place. 
In my opinion, even in this trendy district with the high cost of rent, these little pies are still only worth $15 tops. Even at $18 they'd be stretching it, but $26? Little wonder I sensed a hiccup from the manager after we talked about the pies at the other place...

If these pies were twice the size and depth and pounded your taste buds with flavour and texture, I'd consider returning. But as it is, likely not. Too bad.",380,4/24/2018 23:23,TRUE,0.155777248

Upon arriving the person behind the counter was very nice and tried his best to explain to me how this LAN cafe works as I'm used to the traditional LAN cafes of just walking in and paying an hourly fee. However, here at Wolf and Lamb PC, it's quite different. It is almost like a tight knit community of gamers. The initial cost per hour for ""non members"" is $4 an hour and to become a member you pay a flat one time $10 fee to join, which drops your hourly rate to $3 an hour. However if you come here regularly or even purchase a monthly or weekly pass you automatically become a member.  Now what makes this LAN cafe different from the others? Well they have an official World of Warcraft guild that if you join your hourly rate gets dropped to $2 an hour. What if you don't play World of Warcraft? No worries! Each day they have a specific game genre that you can play at the cost of $2 per hour and sometimes it'll be free all day. On Mondays it's free to play fighting games only, on Tuesdays it's MOBA games, on Wednesday's it's family day so it's buy one hour get one hour free. Thursday's it's sports games and Fridays are tournament days and depending on the tournament you may not even have to pay. What's even better is that at the end of every ""season"" depending on what genre of game you play, for example a MOBA game like league of legends, each ranked game you win you'll get one point and whoever has the most point at the end of the ""season"" will earn a prize ranging from gift cards to game cards. They also have a streaming room for $8 an hour which includes a standalone microphone alongside a dual monitor set up and a green-screen. With today's generations of triple AAA titles like Call of Duty, you would need quite a powerful PC to run everything on max settings. After going through the main specs, it appears that all of the computers are prebuilt by a company I have never heard before but they all have a GTX 1070 and an i7700 which is pretty decent since the i7 7700 is about 3 years old and the 1070 is also about 3 years old but still a strong card. Some games I tested were Call of duty black ops 4, fortnite, and league of legends. All of them ran flawlessly at max settings. I did however turn off shadows in fortnite and black ops 4 as shadows tend to drop your frames per second (FPS) a lot and saw huge improvement when shadows were turned off. Another thing I liked was that the monitors are 144hz (the screen refreshes 144 times per second) which is great since 144hz monitors are basically the industry standard for gaming. If you're not into pc gaming that's totally fine, they have board games as well as a bunch of ps4's and Xbox one's with the latest titles such as Red Dead Redemption 2. They also have some previous generation consoles such as the Wii U, but they also have the Nintendo switch as well. Overall I'd say this place is a solid 4 out of 5. Reason being is the whole membership fees can be confusing as well as not having a manager on duty during my stay of at least 4 hours. One thing I would like to see is more computers and making the place more spacious as it can feel really tight if the place gets packed. Aside from that this is a really nice LAN cafe that is great to hangout with friends to play some Mario Games or compete in tournaments. As with any LAN/Gaming cafe, never save your login credentials and make sure to sign out of the pc when you're done to ensure your information is not saved!",686,11/26/2018 20:58,TRUE,0.113407455

Upon entering this great little store I was greeted by one of the owners.  She welcomed me in and walked over to see if I needed some assistance.  Since I was just wandering by after having a late breakfast across the way I thanked her and said I'd see her at the register.  

This is the type of store that once you walk in you can't walk out without finding something awesome to take home.  I would love for the owner to come to my house and decorate exactly as she has in this store.  It's a unique mix of home furnishings & wall hangings to Alex and Ani bracelets to specialty baby items like beautiful baby bags and clothing.  There are some really beautiful angel wings hanging on the wall.  So freaking awesome!  Today I found my bestie the cutest most comfortable pair of slippers.  When I say cute I am talking soft and cushiony with the most gorgeous fat ribbon bow on top with beautiful crystals adorning the bow. So unique and special.  I also picked up a few of their food items.  My mom loves scones so I got a box of scone mix and some specialty jam.  

This store is special because they offer things you can't find just anywhere.  They sell the little touches of comfort you place around your home to make it more personal.  Prices are very reasonable and the service here is great.  They make you feel like family!

Parking is a breeze as you can park in front of the store or behind.  It's such a pleasant center and the ambiance both inside and outside the store is so great.  Can't wait to come back and see what they come up with next as I overheard they were adding a bunch of new items over the next few days!",352,5/13/2015 1:27,TRUE,0.115262484

Came in for a gel refill, it cost me 40$ plus 6$ tip. If you pay with card they add a 15% extra.

Here they have a cute little tray with all the tools they need to do the refill and a separate little tub for the different ends they need for the nail gun.

The lady who did my nails was nice enough, she did chat a lot with her friends in a different language which is ok but I like talking to people as my nails get done, so it would have been nice to be included in the conversation.

With three locations, one being downtown at Yonge and Bloor, another at Sherway Garden and this location in Yorkdale Mall, gives a variety of locations to choose from. Being located in one of the biggest malls in Toronto, you get to have other reasons to pay a visit to this store. 

The store consist of booths and boutique stores that will give a great focus on specific product lines. Having boutique stores such as Louis Vuitton, Chanel, Gucci, Prada etc, will allow each store to display their very own look and brands the way they want to. Holt's main focus is to sell only and nothing but independent and high end brands from all over the world.

With valet parking and greeters, makes the store experience must more special as they would treat you with great honour. The staff is super nice and their service is super great. 

Every so often you'll catch a sale event that will give you crazy deals such as 70% off and hourly specials from specific boutique brands. if you can get to these, be ready for some fighting and shoving. With pricing being sky-rocketed, any sale that you can grab, take it. 

If hungry or thirsty during shopping then hit up the Holt Cafe for some grub. it's pricy but the food is more gourmet rather then the typical fast food. The bloor location is an actual restaurant but the Yorkdale location is more pre-made food. I would honestly just go to the mall and get your food from there if you're join to spend that much on food that you can get cheaper else where.

We tried a tuna ""baco"", a chicken baco, and a broccoli side, and all were very fresh and tasty. It was a pleasant surprise getting food this nice in a shopping mall food court.

Having said that, the food wasn't perfect. The baco bread was surprisingly, unforgivably tough and chewy. Both bacos were kinda skimpy on the protein. And, at the risk of being too nitpicky, the $8.50 bacos were a weird tweener size -- one baco isn't enough for a meal, but two is too much. I suppose the idea is that you order a baco and a couple of sides, which at $15 would end up being pretty steep for a food court meal.

Last but not least, the little side we got was packaged in a non-recyclable plastic container. It kind of sucked to throw it away after using it for five minutes.

Still, this is the best place in Market Mall's food court -- it tastes like real food, not food court junk food. Definitely tasty enough for a return visit.

Edit: The bacos we ordered on our second visit were soft and fluffy like we expected them to be, so I chalk up the tough, chewy bacos we got on our first visit to startup problems (our first visit was on the first day they were open).",244,3/8/2016 2:25,FALSE,1

The food quality and flavor was out of this world - more than I expected to be honest! One of the things I love most is how they teach you to utilize fresh/simple ingredients to make something that's high-impact! Also, I feel fairly confident I could manage this recipe at home.

I came here as a walk-in as a group of 4 and luckily there was no line and we had just seen a table open up from a fully packed restaurant. We were told we would be seated there when it was cleared but instead, the servers came back and said they had promised it to an existing party of 2 already who wanted to sit in the booth. Ok - minor inconvenience but we just came for dinner so the servers offered us the counter instead once they cleared it. We happily agreed to that. 

However, the servers then came back and told us the counter seats were reserved so there was no table available for 4 anymore. Bigger inconvenience because we came to the area just to try the food here, as we are all fans of the downtown location, and now had to wait an unknown amount of time. There was no sign of a table for 4 opening up so we settled on splitting our group and taking two tables for 2 across the restaurant from each other. 

At my table, we did not get any menu for over 10 minutes nor did anyone come to our table after we were seated. I texted my friend on the other side of the restaurant to see if he got a menu yet and he brought over their extra menu because they had two. We also saw a person walk up to the servers to ask if they could place their order because they had been waiting for a while, albeit with a menu at their table. Looked like a few folks were not happy about the service that night. 

Food took terribly long. It took so long that the table of 2 that moved to the 4-seater had finished their meal and left. Our two tables were eventually able to move and sit together at the original table we were promised - all this happened after about 40 mins after originally being seated and still before any food was served. 

When the food did come out, about another 15 minutes after we moved (and almost an hour from originally being seated), they missed one meal so that ended up coming another 15 mins later. The servers said they would give us a discount for forgetting the food and we ended up with a 15% discount - similar discount you would get if you tagged them on Instagram. 

About the food, the curry is great! The same great flavour as the downtown location. They ran out of the beef skewers but the chicken one was ok. Good green onion flavour. Only good things to say about the food but the terrible service soured my experience here. The servers were pleasant and polite, and I believe they were working to the best of their ability, but there seems to be poor management/training of the staff.

The worst part for me though was the outcome - two nails were cut on a diagonal (irreparably until they grow back), and I wasn't asked what shape I wanted my nails to be.

This was the dirtiest experience I've ever had at a nail salon and my nails look terrible.

The only reason I'm giving two stars (v. 1)  is because I shared the feedback with the owner at the time who seemed genuinely disappointed. She offered me a discount (which I did not accept) and offered to fix my nail. At that point, I had been there a full two hours and was ready to take all of the polish off -- there is no way I was staying a second longer.",307,5/13/2018 1:18,TRUE,0.071467227

Z4VQkDzs4P-79oq4bNK1hw,c2suqkLVknIV0kisV2RRpA,_adbswq_0E8MoJ9eoVf6vw,2,1,1,1,"Needed a place to stay on Saturday night when taking my kids down to the Burgh. This was the cheapest place I could find with a room that could accommodate all of us (me and youngest in the King bed - it was Mother's Day weekend, and I claim the big bed!; middle son and oldest on the pullout sleeper sofa). Plus, it had an indoor pool/hot tub with which to keep the youngest two occupied. The location (immediately off I-376) was close enough to where we were going to be hanging out (The Waterfront in Homestead) and also conducive to taking their little happy asses back home.

We got there about 4 PM and to get to the hotel, you have to go up this very steep, curvy hill. One thing about Pittsburgh - they can build anything on a hill. Upon checking in, it turned out we arrived at the same time the people from the wedding reception did. It also appeared that most of them were spending the night there too. Joy.

The hotel is considerably old - I think the carpeting is a lovely burnt orange from the 70's, with distinct brown spots that may either be designs or blood stains. I'm not sure which. There are three sections to the prison....er, hotel - A, B, and C. We were in the C-section (ha!) on the first floor, which had a little patio that faced woods. It's weird - none of the levels really match the building next to it, so what was the first floor of one building was the second floor of the other building. Tres confusing.

Upon entering the room and leaving the sketchy hallway, I was happy to see that the rooms were up to date. I was not amused to see that the television was on - I wasn't quite sure I was in the right room or if someone else was there. Luckily, we were the only people who were supposed to be in there. The hotel has WiFi and the room had a mini fridge; the one thing that it didn't have was a lot of outlets, especially any around the bed or the computer desk. We had to unplug most of the lights in the room so that we could run two laptops and two PSP's.

We went out for the evening and came back around 11 PM, only to find all of the well lit parking places taken. We had to park pretty far from the door, and it was in a dark area that was surrounded  by woods. Nothing screams ""target!"" like a single woman with small kids. We  made it to the hotel entrance okay, and I'm writing this review, so I am assuming we were all unscathed.

The bed was very comfy and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. Little room, if any, to navigate in there. Basically the toilet is almost IN the shower. It is also very low to the ground, so you're sitting with your knees up by your ears almost. The previously documented bottle opener was also right at eye level as you were sitting. That weirded me out.

Offspring and I went to go get our complimentary breakfast so that we could take it down to the pool and eat poolside before they went in. What a cluster***k! There were almost 100 people in that restaurant, and most of them were of Indian descent, all screaming at each other, and cutting in front of people just to grab stuff. I am lucky that we made it out of there with two bowls of cereal and a piece of sausage. 

The pool is very large, and it was nicely heated (although the pool area itself was cold as all get out). Kids will like it - it's a pool. Adults should be fine with it. I took advantage of the hot tub - I sat on the edge of it with my legs covered up to my knees in water because it was so cold in there and I read a book. 

All in all, we lived. Would I stay here again? Most likely not. There are other hotels in the area that were about the same price range, with the same amenities, and less sketch factor. But, if all you need is a place to stay and you're fine with the above, then this place should suit you fine.

I got out of a late movie and was craving some nachos. I hadn't been to Montana's in over 3 years and it's not my #1 choice. But it was close by, so we decided to just go there. It was a Thursday evening, so the restaurant was only a quarter full and we were sat pretty quickly. The menu said that the only nachos they had were ""Pulled Pork Nachos"". I like pulled pork, so I decide to settle for those even though I wanted just plain nachos. We also decided on a caesar salad to share and deep fried pickles. We promptly put in our order, and that was probably the most service we received all night. We saw several staff members walking around, chatting and ignoring customers. It seems to me that Montana's tends to hire really young servers (barely 18 I think) that don't give a crap about their job. 
The food took almost 40 minutes to arrive. The starter caesar salad was pretty disappointing. It was extremely small (small even for a starter), and looked like that bagged iceberg lettuce from Safeway with bacon bits and Renee's Caesar Salad Dressing. I could make that at home, and do a way better job too. The deep fried pickles were alright, but the batter was a bit thick. The worst was the Pulled Pork Nachos. There was barely any cheese on the nachos, and it wasn't even melted cheese. The pulled pork was disgustingly sweet, almost like they were sitting in maple syrup for a week. It made the nachos taste awful. 
I tried to flag down the server, but had no luck. So, unfortunately, I was so hungry that I ate around the horrible pulled pork as best I could. That was the theme of the service all night. As soon as we placed our order, we didn't see our server again until we were done eating. Our drinks had been sitting empty for a while, and she asked if we wanted more drinks as she was bringing over our bill. Since I work in the service industry, I still tipped her, though not nearly as much as I usually do because of her nonexistent service.

From my experience most of these reviews on here are are accurate.  Being new to the area and not knowing their extensive history of customer dissatisfaction I stopped in between work and a meeting at church.  Since Dairy Queen was offering a free cone on the first day of spring 3/20/17 I figured I would stop by to grab that and something to eat.  It was about 6:15pm and they were closed even though Dairy Queen website says they are open until 8:00pm.  Jumping forward a little bit when I called today the rude lady said they close at 5 on Mondays.  Seriously what restaurant closes at 5?  When I looked on the door it had two signs on the door.  One that because they are a franchise they will only be participating in the free cone from 11-12 today.   That is insane because I would guess all the other franchise Dairy Queen's were giving them away all day.  The second sign said they were out of chocolate ice cream (which on Wednesday is still on the door). So they apparently can not keep food in stock like previous post state and they can't order it when they do run out.  When I called the store today I asked to speak to the manager to get the name and contact information for the owner franchise owner.  She rudely said why are you asking so I explained what happened Monday and instead of complying she just gave the excuse about being a franchise they don't have to follow Dairy Queen programs.  When I tried to question her isn't that what a franchise does receive their food and licensing from Dairy Queen she said no and then announced she was hanging up without giving me the information I sought.  Then when I tried to call back they just let it ring.  Since it was only a short drive I decided to go and talk to the manager only to find that on Wednesday's they close at 6pm 2 hours before the time the Dairy Queen says they close.  The funny thing in the 5 minutes that I was looking at something on my phone in the lot 5 other customers drove up and walked up to the door to find that they were closed.

I stayed here back around early February with my husband to get away for a few days, something like a little vacation. We have never been to Charlotte, but we would always hear amazing things. Checking in was one of the only nice things, we spoke to a Micha who was very professional and courteous and gave us a warm smile when checking in. He let us know of local restaurants and things to do in the area which was very helpful. There was a lot of people walking in and out of the doors yelling to each other and being very loud, which was a little shocking, but we decided to disregard that. To our surprise some of the same people (who were in street clothes) were actually workers and went behind the desk speaking very loudly and cursing, not even caring that we are standing at the desk as customers. How can a place be this unprofessional. The walk to the room I must say was very uncomfortable. There were a group of guys hanging outside in the back corner of the hotel smoking and starring at us as we were walking across the street to the second building. Maybe they thought they knew us, but it was a little awkward since they starred the whole time gesturing and laughing with each other. We got into the building and approaching the second floor there was a strong smell from what it seemed to be marihuana from the strong musty smell, or some other drug. Either way it was very unpleasant and not a smell any hotel should be proud of. We unfortunately had to deal with that disgusting smell THE WHOLE TIME we stayed here. I let the front desk know about the smell after day one since I could not get in touch with the manager who happened to be away for the whole time we stayed here, which was another inconvenience, for emergencies, how can the owner not be around? The room wasn't bad, we were fortunate enough to have a decent room at least, but the look was very old and outdated. Doesn't compare to the pictures online at all. We had maintenance come to fix our shower head, the water was spitting out in all directions. The maintenance guy was young looking, but very nice and made me feel comfortable with fixing the shower while I ran out for food. I came back and he showed me how he fixed it, it was perfect. I believe his name was Loe/Leonard. By that night, it seemed more rooms filled up with more check ins and more smoke was filtering through the hallways and stairwell. It was so horrible. Due to my bad experience since day one, I really doubted anything would happen and I was right. We stayed for four days and every day got worse. The breakfast crew were full of smiles, but the food itself seemed old and cheap, so we ended up eating out everyday.

My mom has been here on several occasions and has raved about it so we figured why not. Our stomachs had control at this point and honestly, soup on a cold day sounded very appealing. 

And it's not often you see both owners walking around the place asking you how everything is and if you could use anything. Really nice people who worked there.

Our waitress was killer awesome. She took our order by memory and we both ordered the corn beef hash that came with a bread roll, salad and two eggs for $7. Cool. 

When the food came out my eyes got as big as my stomach felt empty. The portions were HUGE! My sister and I could've definitely split one. The bread was made by hand I'm 99% sure and was delightful. I ended up with a salad (which was also huge for a side salad...nothing fancy but fresh and homemade dressing) whereas the sis subbed in some clam chowder soup and insisted I try it. I don't like clams...well...not of that particular nature anyway. ;) It was really delicious and had great flavor and consistency. Not watered down or anything that would remotely resemble an instant soup.

My sister and I easily ended up getting containers for our food as there was no way we could eat it all. On the way out, I couldn't help but admire the cheesecake that called my name before me. It was their chocolate one (cannot remember the name of it as I was so mesmerized) and looked super rich but divine. I had to have it. So I got two. No, that wasn't my inner fat-kid talking...I bought one for my parents to split ya weirdos. The lady at the counter was super nice and boxed up the slices in a safe-transport container...which my car appreciated.

Definitely will be back to try other things. Really enjoyed it and their coffee kicks ass too. Very good, even black, with hints of chocolate in that too. Loved it! GO! Do it now! :D",378,9/18/2012 16:11,TRUE,0.09229136

Being a restaurant that focuses on steaks and ribs, you would assume that they have become quite good at cooking them. Unfortunately, this is not the case at Montana's. When I was there last, they did not even have any beef ribs as they had sold out of them. Instead I got the rib eye steak which was a very poor cut of meat. The steak itself was cooked to my preference but the fat was impossible to cut through with the very dull steak knife I was provided. Some of the people I was with got the pork ribs and found them to be extremely dry and cold when served. The restaurant was busy, but they also took far longer than they should have to cook the food. The service was also quite spotty but good when they around. I don't understand why the prices are so high in Montana's in comparison to similar restaurants.

The food was amazing. We started off with the falafel platter which was served with their house made pita and a generous helping of hummus. The falafels were crispy and full of flavour and made for a great combination with everything on the plate. Next was the pepperoni pizza. You'd think it would be very simple but the dry aged pepperoni was what intrigued us. Fresh from the oven, the pizza was full of flavour and had a nice crunch to it.

This is something we do all the time since we need to have two beds.  If the hotel says they only have a king then we don't book with them.  The hotel staff assured us that they had a two bed handicap room.   So we called back the agent and booked the hotel with handicap room.  When we go there they didn't have this room and the first night we stayed in a room with two beds but the bathroom was so small it couldn't be used by the handicap person who was on the trip.  The next day they moved us to the handicap room and brought in a roll away bed which worked but it wasn't what we paid for.

Pastas are off the chart. I had linguine pescadora which is a seafood pasta dish. OMG it was succulent and cooked perfectly. Sauce was soooo good. 

We also ordered the ribeye steak.  They cooked it exactly how we ordered it. And wow wow wow. Sapore isn't known as a steakhouse but I will say they rival some steakhouses I have been to. They had this blueberry sauce they put o. The steak that I thought would taste bad. But my gosh. It actually worked so well. 

Seafood dish is also amazing. Salmon Scallops and Shrimp were grilled to perfection. And the grilled calamari in this dish proved they can cook calamari any way you want it. 

The pizza is fantastic as well. Make sure to ask for it to be cooked well done and you will get an authentic Italian pizza.

Some quick tips: Start off with the baby or mini size.  With the number of times they dip the cone into the melted chocolate (of your choice), it'll be sugar overload.  If you can eat more, then hey, you can try other flavours and toppings!

The soft serve ice cream itself is delicious.  Very creamy! I'm sure many people will focus more on the toppings but if you're someone looking for just a regular/plain soft serve ice cream, then you won't be disappointed. 

I haven't tasted all of the chocolate sauce but so far, the ones I've tried are very good.  Seems as though they had taken chocolate bars and just melted them as they are quite rich.  Whenever you get a cone, they dip the ice cream 2 to 3 times and in the end, the chocolate coating will be pretty thick.  This is why I recommend starting off with a baby or mini size.  

Whether or not you're very much into sweets and may or may not find it too be too much, it'll still taste really good. I'm personally happy that there is such a cool trendy place in the east side and that you don't have to make a trek downtown.

I took the Thai cooking class at Sur La Table this week, which advertised instruction for pad thai, chicken curry, pork larb, and mango rice pudding. Overall, the class was underwhelming, rather boring, and not terribly informative. 'Cooking' is a generous description for what actually happened. The class was about 11 people with 3 prep stations and 2 stove burners, which was too crowded to get any hands on experience. As a result, most of the class consisted of standing and watching other group members simmer pre-chopped and pre-measured ingredients in a pot. While we ate portions from all 4 meals, as individuals we only prepared about 1/3 of the final product. It would have been more interesting and way more informative to spend the money on ingredients and bumble my way through this at home. I have taken a Thai cooking class in the past, and this was pretty bad in comparison.

While the class overall took about 2.5 hours, a large majority was spent focused on shopping-related information. There was a sizable break in the middle for shopping and the teacher spent much of the class talking about products (i.e. knives, mortar & pestles), rather than talking about the actual process of cooking. The instructions that were given were vague and complicated to understand. 

Overall, not a huge fan of a class with this breadth and size. Before booking check and see what the total class enrollment is. Similarly, I think a class with fewer foods being prepared may be more worthwhile.",272,1/21/2016 21:12,FALSE,0.106308255

The park takes its name from a member of the Springs family and contains many historic buildings that either already existed on the land or were located nearby and moved here for preservation.

The park has trails for hikers, walkers, biking, and horseback.  Haigler Lake has a launch for canoes and kayaks.  Plenty of picnic tables abound with a shelter or two available as well.  There is also camping allowed on the property.  I'm sure there's more this park offers but that's only the parts I saw.

The barn is quite large and they turned one of the silos into a tower where you can climb the steel stairs inside the silo and view across the park.

There's a trail indicating the great wagon road which was used by traders in early settler days.  I found this very interesting because one of maps indicated the path and it went through the area where I grew up in Pennsylvania.  So I have my connection to up north at this park.  :)

There's a small waterfall off the back of Haigler Lake that is worth a picture or two as well as the lake.  On my last visit there was a kayaker fishing on the lake.

For birdwatchers, there's a lot of bluebird activity in this park.

The park ranger at the entrance gate was very helpful and asked if I had been there before and gave a tip on what to see.

The phony high school student working as a bank representative there did stop the charges, I'll give him credit for that. (This requires signing up for a new ""free"" banking system that requires you to use your B of A credit card once a month or face a $15 fee. And no, on-line purchases don't count. Go figure.)  But when I asked about refunds or at least finding out why my account changed without my knowledge, he said something about his computer being down and that he would call me within the week to let me know.

It's been a month now. Guess if I've heard from him. 

I was also supposed to get new checks for getting the new account. Nope! Not yet, anyway!

Since I've been a B of A customer I've dealt with $1400 in bank fraud, (which they refunded and then suddenly took back out of my account when a representative made a typo on the amount,) have received checks with the wrong account number on them and then denied new checks when I didn't bring one in for proof, have been denied a bank letter required for a student visa, have been charged fees for not having money in an account I'd already closed, and countless other annoyances that are unacceptable for banking.

While searching for a venue, I found MonOrchid on Yelp and assumed they were way beyond my price range (I had visited once during First Fridays and LOVED the space.) I emailed for pricing information and quickly heard back from Stefanie with details. I was surprised that MonOrchid was a few hundred to a few thousand dollars cheaper than other downtown Phoenix venues. Stefanie told me that we could use our own caterers and alcohol, as long as we hired a professional bartender. If you've hosted an event, you know this is a savings of another couple thousand dollars.

Stefanie was great at helping us decide on a layout for our event. She made suggestions and allowed us to visit on several occasions. She was especially helpful in contacting our vendors to confirm details. On the night of the event, Stefanie even lent a hand in putting a nice cheese tray together while I was busy.

Flashforward to looking for wedding venues, when I heard we were going to check it out I was almost already sold on it.  

Our event turned out better than I thought is was going to visually. It was the exact atmosphere we were looking for, we didn't want a cheesy banquet hall with floral carpets or a golf course like most people do and we didn't have a lot of money to spend on other places.  This place was right in our budget and was easily one of the highlights of my wedding. Riette runs the place and she couldn't have been more enjoyable to work with, she was easy going and didn't really put a lot of restirctions on us for what we could or couldn't do.

Overall, with some family members in the wedding industry, it's hard to find things that are new to them and have that wow factor. This place just had it all.",179,12/1/2010 21:17,TRUE,0.122474266

#NAME?,4EcXeoU6_soBxm73UbDNRw,_a_tio6zND31Wp5B3rn2uQ,1,4,0,0,"I moved out almost a year ago, I have many issues with this place.

First, when I looked at the apartment I was showed a two bedroom with a ""loft' which was just an extra room with no door and a desk built into the walls. I loved that about it. What I moved into was a three bedroom apartment missing the desk. It took them almost two months to get the desk in the apartment and it was POORLY put in. There were cracks everywhere and the installers left caulking all over. 

As for the apartment itself, mine was located in a beautiful area in the complex. It was almost my favorite place to live thus far in Las Vegas apartment living. The first year was great, it was quiet and clean.

Maintenance is poor. The maintenance manager was great and knew what he was doing, his staff did not. Things were not fixed the way they should have been, just slapped together to make it work. 

When the new management took over, I was forced to pay my ""water, sewer, trash"" bill with my rent even though it is from a different company and had a different due date than rent. They would NOT accept rent without those utilities being paid as well. Their online system sucks, they charge for everything. 

PEST CONTROL uses these really strong chemicals that smelled 8 hours after they came. I was actually worried about my dogs in the apartment while I was gone. Pest Control even left the key to my apartment in the door lock one day after spraying my apartment. Luckily my girlfriend found it first and we held onto it waiting for the office to contact us and let us know that there was a key to our apartment missing and they needed to come and change the locks. That never happened. 

The office staff changed often but the cast of characters were all the same. No one knew what they were doing. The phone is never answered. One staff member will tell you one thing while the manager tells you something else. I had the staff hand me over other peoples packages before, did they even look first? 

Mail boxes are always getting broken into. People leave their dogs feces all over the place even though the apartments threaten extra charges. How are they going to find out who's dog left it? 

I had my car towed from the property! They have a tow company come in once a month or so and tag cars that have been sitting, parked in an incorrect parking spot or cars with missing registration stickers. I was missing a sticker on my BRAND NEW CAR which I had just given them information on a few weeks prior. Since I transferred my registration from my old car to my new car, I did not have a sticker and needed to have one ordered. In the mean time, I communicated this to one person in the office staff. The next day my car was gone. really? After telling management what happened they told me ""I'll see what I can do"" and called the tow company and ""paid"" to get my car out for me. Ridiculous to have this happen when there were broken down cars and people who didn't even live there taking up spaces, which brings me to my next paragraph.

The second year of living in these apartments were the worst. There was someone who moved into a different building than I but still near me. They fought with their ""boyfriend"" all the time, in the middle of the night. The boyfriend did not live there though he stayed and parked in 2 parking spots all the time. They were up all hours, had people coming and going, would scream in the parking lot, screech their tires every time they left and FIGHT in the parking lot. In the middle of the night one time we were woken up to them fighting again then another man got into it, they started fist fighting and someone started yelling about guns. Where is security? Ohhhhh, they leave at 2 am. I asked the office why security leaves in the middle of the night, no answer. I saw security maybe 5 times in the two years that I lived there. 

Honestly, I loved the apartment and I loved how well the property was taken care of. If they didn't want to keep raising my rent, and got rid of tenants that caused problems, I may have stayed.",762,3/30/2018 22:19,TRUE,0.154173332

The decor is a rustic look that is popular now and fits perfectly with the menu. There is seating outside also. Doggies are welcome outside I heard while I was there. You order at the counter.
