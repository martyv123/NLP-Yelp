"This hotel wasn?t great because it was a long walk from the center of the city. There were also not many nearby restaurants. In general, the check-in process took quite long, though it was friendly. It took about 20 minutes. The staff were also somewhat rude and they weren?t all really eager to assist us. My other complaint is that the shower pressure was a bit too low, however apparently the hotel is planning on fixing this issue."
"The hotel was outside the city, so it was pretty quiet but far away from all the action. The room wasn?t very clean and the bathroom was small. The room service was slow, but the staff were friendly enough. Another issue was that we had to pay for wifi, and the connection was not very fast, so it wasn?t worth it. The television also played a weird selection of channels, so that wasn?t an amazing addition."
"The check-in process took forever, which wasn?t great after a long day of traveling. The hotel itself was homey, clean, and overall welcoming. The room and the bathroom were very small and old though, which wasn?t all too evident in pictures online. We ordered room service multiple times, and the delivery was slow as well. Another downside was that my room was located right outside a highway, so it was very difficult to get a good night?s sleep."
"All-in-all, I had a pretty lousy stay at this hotel. We were first greeted by an unfriendly staff who let us carry our luggage all the way to our room. We then went downstairs to the hotel restaurant, which had just a short list of food options. There was a bar that my husband and I wanted to enjoy at night, but it was closed for renovation, as well as the heated pool. One additional problem that I had was that there was no room temperature control, which posed an issue during one of the colder nights."
"I would not recommend this hotel to anyone going on a family vacation. The atmosphere is not very welcoming and definitely inappropriate for small children. There is a heated pool and a Jacuzzi on the first floor, but there are constantly loud people in there with alcoholic beverages. The snack bar on the first floor is open until late at night, which makes a lot of noise. The area around the hotel also didn?t feel very safe, and I wasn?t comfortable walking around at night. Another problem with the location is that it is very difficult to find with a GPS, and it can be noisy at night because it is on the bikers? route to the South. Other than that, I found the staff to be relatively hospitable."
"The room wasn?t very clean and the bathroom was kind of small. The room service was somewhat slow, but the staff were friendly. There was a restaurant on the first floor with a very basic, yet affordable menu. My other issue was that we had to pay for wifi, though the connection was slow, so it wasn?t worth it. The television also played only a few weird channels, so this was also a problem."
"The room service wasn?t speedy, though the staff were relatively hospitable. The room could be more tidy and the bathroom was hard to squeeze in. There was a small restaurant located on the first floor that offered some simple, reasonably-priced menu options. Another issue is that there was no breakfast included in our stay, but restaurants around opened very late. Another small issue was that we had to pay for wifi, but the wireless connection was OK, so it was fine."
"The room was not well-kept, with some old corroded fixtures, and the bathroom was tiny; We had to pay for wifi, and it wasn?t worth it because the connection was interrupting all the time. The area around the hotel also didn?t feel very safe, and I wasn?t comfortable walking around at night. The room service was disappointing, and the staff weren?t all very kind. There was a diner on the first floor, but it was also not well-kept and offered affordable but dull dishes."
"Finding this hotel was very difficult, as it does not show up on GPS maps. When we got there, we found the room underprepared, and the bathroom was so small I could hardly close the door behind me. There was a dining area on the first floor that offered inexpensive but really basic food options. The room service wasn?t amazing either, as the staff were not eager to assist us. My other dilemma was that they did not have free wifi, so we bought it for one night, but the connection was so lousy that we gave up on it the other nights."
"The room service was very unimpressive and you would wait too long. The staff weren?t always available either. This hotel could be great because it was only a short walk from the center of the city. But the area didn?t feel safe, especially at night. Another problem that I had was that we had to pay for the wifi service; The room was probably once elegant, but it wasn?t well-kept and the bathroom was super small. There was also a restaurant on the first floor with cheap menu options. We didn?t try them out, they didn?t look very appetizing."
