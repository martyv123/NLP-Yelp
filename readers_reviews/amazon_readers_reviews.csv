"Let's be honest...this isn't a GoPro, but it's also nowhere near GoPro pricing.  For the price, the picture quality and video quality is pretty good. Appears to be very well constructed, and comes with two batteries (charge while inside the camera). It also comes with a waterproof case, and about 6 million mounts. So many I haven't found what to do with them all yet. I purchased this due to not wanting to spend 200-500 on a GoPro that I would realistically only used a handful of times. This is perfect for that use. Now if I was going to use on my weekly downhill ski runs I'd probably get a GoPro for improved video quality and speed as well as increased options."
"I bought this before I went on vacation to Hawaii, and I'm so happy with it!! The first two photos were taken while snorkling at 1080p quality. Pros: Picture quality is indistinguishable from a GoPro; It's only $50; Comes with every assessory you could possibly need and more; Ability to change out the battery instead of having to charge the camera itself.   Cons: Short battery life (20-30 min); Cheaper construction vs go pro; Footage bellow 15 feet is hard to see (may be able to fix this with a lense filter).   Special note for Scuba Divers: The very last picture taken was at a depth of 35 feet on a sunny day. The photos and videos turned out very blue, dark, and almost unuseable."
"You can't beat the price for a camera with the same features as a GoPro, plus it comes with several extra mounts and attachments.  It comes with the waterproof case and it works perfectly. I dove down about 15-18' and it worked just fine. Surprisingly, the battery lasted quite a while on picture mode, too. It also takes pretty decent video (but that mode drains the battery relatively quickly). Another pro is that it comes with two batteries so you can always have a back-up. Some cons: The zipper case has a weak zipper that won't last long. The instruction booklet is just ""ok""  but the pictures are helpful. Overall, I am happy to have some great underwater pictures."
I purchased this at the last min to take on a vacation not expecting much. I didn't really use the video feature that much or use it under water for many photos since the ocean was a little murky however it took great photos above the water while on our paddle boards. It was easy to figure out and easy to use. If you aren't going to be an avid user of this type of camera this is pretty darn great for the cost and all that it comes with. I have taken it on several trips and used it as a camera in place of my iPhone simply because of its durability and the safety of it being in a waterproof case.
"No, it's not the well known brand but it's also not 5x the costs. Very compact and tons of accessories that are compatible with the well known brand. I love the waterproof case and being able to take images/video under the water. This helps with my swimming technique or just for having some fun. The case it comes with is very nice and professional, with part specific cutouts so you know where everything is safely stored. The video is very impressive and more than what you would expect for a camera this inexpensive. I use it when cycling just in case I'm involved in an accident with an automobile or have an unfriendly encounter with someone. I ordered a 32GB micro-SD card with it as well which holds just enough video for when I need to have the camera on during my rides. Four stars but only because the battery life doesn't last as long as I would like and no remote control."
I've been very excited about my new camera I've been waiting for my SD card I finally got my SD card I've been figuring it out on my own because I did not get a manual. My friend also ordered a camera he said he has a manual so maybe I'll be able to figure more out then I also didn't get my push button thing for your wrist. My camera was on backorder because I picked out the blue one. It was supposed to be in withina couple of weeks but after a few days they said they had one I just think it's one that somebody's sent back and they kept the button and the manual. Can't wait to use it at Panama City Beach I will update my review after I'm in the water with it.
"Setup was fairly easy, SD card format was a little different than some of the other reviews but given two options, confirm or cancel, I clicked confirm and was formatted perfectly. I downloaded the app and followed the instructions on page 8 for the installation of the app and was able to transfer my photos no problem. Once I transferred the photos I was able to share, again no problem, but video transfer was a little trickier. I am disappointed that it does not come with a battery charger, and the only way to charge it is to connect the camera to the USB outlet. I think it would be a 5 star if the camera could use the same wifi link as the device you are using for the app."
"3 stars because of the horrible app and useless instructions. For instance WTF does ""stir downward the battery cover"" even mean? There is more interesting and indecipherable Chinglish but thats the one I found the silliest. Camera seems to be decent once you get it rolling. It is kinda lane that it does not automatically become available on the WIFI on power up and you have to go the whole setup every time. Anyway fair camera sucky app mostly. I just use the camera stand alone then pop the SD card into my laptop to grab the video. I might of gone 4 stars if the manual was even remotely useful to an English speaker."
"So far this cam is everything that was advertised.... The only difficulty it the lack of instructions in the manual and the print size of the manual is almost impossible to see/read. My recommendations this the mfgr.: Design zoom buttons to be more quiet....as the ""click"" of the buttons can be heard when zooming on video....; Include at least 3 more locking screw's; Better instructions with larger print; Don't change the camera other than recommendation's... This is an overall Great little camera!"
"I'm no techie, so the instructions could have been clearer, but with the help of online tutorial videos, and two weeks of practice, I'm having fun with it. Even for a senior citizen, this is ""doable"". I haven't uploaded any videos yet, but when I'm ready, I'll know where to find help. And I'll try it in water for the first time today. There are SO many pieces included in this package with no descriptions or suggestions as to their usage. That took a while of fumbling to teach myself about them. I found that to attach the camera to my tripod, I must first place it in the plastic housing; there is nothing on the bottom of the camera itself that allows attachment... but that works! I'm pleased with my purchase so far."
