"First off this is an action camera and for what it is intended to be I really like it.ÿI am mainly happy with the durability of this camera. I've dropped it multiple times from above waist height onto hard floors and it lives in the bottom of a backpack. Plus, it can be completely submerged in water. I am not happy with the sound recording, because the microphone amplifies background sounds and not the main sound, but the video is very decent. Something to remember is that the battery and the camera itself are stationary in the mounting, so if you want to remove them you need to go to a specialty shop. But all in all, this is by far my preferred device when I go for outdoor extreme activity."
"I am an avid extreme-sports guy. I often go alone and use this little camera to leave a good memory. The camera is super durable: it goes with me anywhere, whether I go sky diving, snow biking or deep water diving. It once fell off the cliff and I found it safe and sound about 30 feet below. People say the sound is not amazing, but since I spend a lot of time alone, I don?t really care. Also, I was really mad when I found out that the camera cannot be removed from the housing. But then I went to the shop and now I actually think it?s a good thing because I can be sure it won?t fall. Plus, the screen is great for framing the shot and playback."
"The performance of the new cameras is very good, I'm now shooting mostly on high speed and it works perfectly. One thing I didn't realize when I ordered these was that they are sealed units, you can't replace the battery or replace the external casing: the camera is permanently mounted within the protective housing. It?s not too bad since apparently I can use a portable USB charger to top off the cameras between races so they're always 100%, but it?s still an extra step I never had to worry about before. I don?t use the underwater shooting option, but I hear it?s a cool feature. The picture quality is a big improvement over what I had before, and although the audio isn?t amazing, the camera as a whole is super durable and I know I will not need to replace it soon."
"This model fell short of 5 stars and I'll tell you why: on the one hand, the pictures and video this little camera produces are impressive, but the audio is poor because the mic is in the back of the camera so background noise is twice as loud. I am disappointed that the camera itself cannot be removed from the housing. The website's comparison chart indicated the battery was not removable, and I was ok with that, but it said nothing about the housing. Now I have to be extremely careful so I don't scratch or damage any part of the housing, especially the lens. Fortunately, the camera is incredibly durable: it went through a bike accident and works like new."
"I was looking for action cam and this was the one that kept popping up in online recommendations. I bought it and the next day racked up some great videos of riding my street bike. The video recordings are really sharp and the sound recording is pretty decent as well, though not as good. The only downside is that the camera and water proof case and battery are all attached. If the case cracks there is no replacing case. You are stuck with a broken camera. But I like how simple everything is to understand and manage. The simplistic design makes the camera very-very durable (I don?t always stay on my bike, haha). Bottom line, for the money, this is a good one."
"I won this camera at a company party raffle so I was excited to have this camera. I first tested the camera driving at night and the quality was pretty good. After that I wanted to get some daytime action so I got my bike out and headed down the road. This is where I got some great footage of myself making faces and doing goofy things. Half way through the bike ride my battery nearly went dead, so keep in mind the battery life is not huge. This camera comes with the waterproof housing (not sure if the others do) so that was a money saver. The package I won also had an SD card with it, so more savings there. Overall, I would say if you are just starting out with action cameras, this is the perfect one to get. The only issue is that the sound quality is subpar and I don't think you can take the camera out of the housing. "
"Overall a very good action camera. The high definition looks amazing on playback, it is crisp, smooth, and crystal clear. The wifi is a great feature on the camera. I use the app on my cell phone to access all of the controls and it works flawlessly. I use this camera as a dash cam and being able to control it remotely is invaluable. This feature keeps me from having to reach up to my dash and push any buttons on the camera. I can also see what the camera is seeing so that I can make adjustments to the placement and angle. The app also allows you to start and stop recording without having to touch the actual camera. My only problem with it is that it seems to overheat very easily. Sitting on the dashboard it tends to get warm and then it shuts itself off and displays that it needs to cool off. "
"This camera is amazing and considering the cameras and video recorders of other companies - this is a mighty little device. The view and images are sharp and clear and it's nice to have the onscreen display. My only complaint is there's no way to zoom either on the camera itself or the app required to view on your ipad or iphone. On your car's side mirrors it says ""Objects are closer than they appear"", but after mounting this camera only 10 inches away from our bird feeder, the birds appear farther away. Overall I'm happy with the camera and would recommend this. But if you want external power to extend battery life, you are forced to leave the camera exposed to the weather and unsealed."
"Cool camera. Great picture quality. The LCD screen is a must. The wifi is good too. But the wifi access is a bit of a hassle for use on the phone. Plus with wifi on, it drains the battery quickly even in standby mode. In order to access the camera via a phone you must manually disconnect from a connected wifi network, than connect to the camera wifi. Many extra steps than make quick access impossible. The best solution is the go pro handheld remote. It quickly access all the functions of the camera. One touch record, change modes, etc. The biggest flaw is the non-removable case and battery. I scratched the lens cover a little. I contacted the company and was told there was no way to replace the clear screen ? so that was disappointing. Not a big deal if you don't scratch up the case."
