My time at UML was an incredible experience. I learned more about how the general business world works more than I ever thought I could. I have also made a multitude of friendships and made fantastic memories on campus and at the hockey games as well. I hope to engage in more campus activities in the future.
"I love the school. I have learned so much in class and on campus. I like how there are several clubs and sports and many things to do on and around campus. The professors are awesome and really care about our success. They seem to be as available as they can be, and there are many resources available to students."
So far my experience at the school has been great.ÿ Campus is nice as well as the food.ÿ There's a ton of clubs so everyone can probably find one they like.ÿ Everyone I've met is super nice. The classes are challenging but the teachers I've had are all nice and would help you if you needed it.
"Here at UML, you feel like you are at home. Classes here are very fulfilling, and you feel like you are getting the most out of your education. The professors are working hard to help you in class and at home and there is such a strong feeling of family here. I am sure that I will graduate from here knowing I chose correctly!"
UML is a good school with plenty of opportunities for students to be successful in courses and in the real world. The school has several outstanding on-campus communities and opportunities for students who want extracurricular activities relating to either their major or just for fun. I play basketball here at UML and it's made my experience even better.
I?ve had a good experience at this school. The professors and advisors do a great job of providing a great working environment for students. There is a vibrant social life for students and there is room for everyone to work through a lifestyle that works best for them.
"This school has so much to offer and I'm glad to be apart of it. I grew up in the area and then I joined the Navy and was gone for 9 years and when I came back, the school had expanded way beyond my imagination. To see that much growth and community impact, I couldn't resist the opportunity to earn my degree from UML. This school has definitely out performed my own initial intentions and thoughts."
I have had a good experience at the school so far. I have a good friend group and have been excelling in my classes. I like the business building because it is new and modern. This school definitely helps to prepare their students for the real world as well as life after college.
I had overall a good time at UML. I met incredible people who helped me become the person I am today. I have learned more than I could ever imagined. I am going to miss walking around campus and in UML. I miss already our hockey team. I think any upcoming freshmen will love our diverse population and the city of UML which is very calm and very friendly.
I love UML I am very fortunate to be at this school. I've had the chance to make meaningful connections with students and staff through Greek life. I came into this school and switched into Business and everything during that transition went better than my peers at other schools. I feel that I am learning life lessons as well as practical applications of the content.
"I have had great experiences with the advisors, and they have been knowledgeable to answer any and all questions I've had.ÿ The professors genuinely care about their students, too. The library is one of my favorite places to be. It has spaces to study in groups and spaces to study in silence."
I had a great time at UML. I had great internship experiences and got involved with great clubs on campus. I learned to venture outside of my comfort zone going on a study abroad program and joining Greek life. I would not trade my college experience at UML for anything.
