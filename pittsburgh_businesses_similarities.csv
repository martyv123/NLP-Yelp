That was a sign that I should've just checked out. Me and my friends wanted a place with an indoor pool for a girls night in. Have you ever been berated in a polite tone? I was confused too. This is not the Hilton! You will not get red carpet or even three star service. The concierge was rude and if she reiterated that there are four people to a room one more time even after we got a second one, I was going to lose my mind. I can math. Also, are pets included in this four people per room rule? Every other room has a dog. After the simple math was over and we walked into our rooms we were exhausted. The rooms do have fridges. They don't have microwaves but there's a bar restaurant. The rooms are in need of updating and not just patching the holes on the ceiling update either. You can only stick but so much fancy artwork on the mediocre walls but it doesn't detract that the rooms are old. The pool and indoor hot tub were nice but there's far too much chlorine in the water. The gym is a ""home"" gym at best. There's like three pieces of equipment. As someone who's worked in hospitality, I was really disappointed in the customer service at this place.

We travel quite a bit so checking beds for bed bugs is standard with each place we stay in- unfortunately, this bed was chock full of loose hairs (no bugs) but too many hairs for my taste. 

The main reason we purchased a room at this location was the large pool which is great for kids. Note that the bad lighting in the evening makes the space feel really gross. Some lighting improvements would go along way. Good news is the natural lighting is great in the morning hours and the pool temperature was spot on.

Our room was nice.. the bathroom was a little small, but manageable.  Water pressure, temperature and bathroom amenities were all excellent.  In-Wall AC/Heating unit worked well and ran quietly.  You also get local TV w/ HBO and a coffee maker.  Our room also had a safe and mini-fridge.  Free WiFi acceptable with multiple locations to access throughout the hotel.
You can tell this place gets used heavily, but it's clean inside and out and the staff was very friendly and courteous.  
The challenges:  Difficult to find.  The entrance is a little confusing for the Rodi Rd. address - you actually enter on Maple Lane at the traffic light and go up the hill .  Follow the well placed Comfort Inn signs that lead the way.
Once there and checked in, they usually give you a map showing the layout of the hotel.  It will help you find your room, the layout can be a little confusing but once you get your bearings, you should be fine.
NOTE...  there is no elevator.  If a few steps are a problem, let them know when booking the room.  
Challenges aside, if you're a little budget-minded, this is an excellent alternative to staying downtown.  With light traffic, you're a 15 minute drive to everything the City of Pittsburgh has to offer and even a shorter drive to Monroeville.

Room: Just okay. We had a ""2 queen"" room on the 3rd floor, away from the lobby. There is NO elevator in this hotel, and the parking lot is VERY hilly - this made getting our luggage from the car to the room pretty treacherous. The room itself was just okay in size, and the walls paper thin... add to that a room door that was ""shaved"" way too high at the bottom (probably to accommodate plusher carpet at one time, but now just leaves an inch-wide gap), and don't plan on sleeping much. We heard the drunkards rolling in at 2 am, the early birds going to breakfast, kids running down the hall, cleaning carts rolling, you get the idea... if you're a light sleeper, avoid. Cleanliness was merely O-K.

Amenities: This is a ""no-frills"" place. In the room, you'll get a blow dryer, a television, and some soap. Some other notes:

1 - There is a ""free breakfast"", but the menu items don't change, and it's made with the minimum effort. I'd sooner have gone to a local diner - we forced the food down because it was there and convenient - not because it was edible. 

2 - The pool is an oddity, with a deep end that goes to 10 feet (who does that anymore, and why?!?!?) Also, depending on where you are in the hotel, expect to have to take a plane, a train, and an automobile to get to the pool... we had to walk down 2 VERY long hallways, go down 3 staircases, and walk down another long hallway just to get to it... is this the Comfort Inn exercise program? 

3 - Expect the outside entry doors to not take your card... it's a fact, and the hotel staff will tell you outright the key entries are old and don't work. If you go outside, plan to have to bang on the door to beg some other sap to let you in, or to have to go through the lobby.

4 - Parking is LIMITED... if you arrive any time past 5:00 pm ET (or come back from a day out), plan to have a really tough time finding a spot to park.

Sleep: Borderline poor. Note the details in the ""room"" section - I'm a light sleeper, and the noise was tough on me at points through the night.

Hotel Staff: Non-existent. The staff manning the desk was okay, not overly nice, not rude. They handed me our keys, and that was that. We never saw nor heard from them again.

Value: Poor, considering the location and the run-down state of the hotel. It was clean enough, yes, but bare bones, not up to modern standards by a long shot. Their rooms don't measure up to nearby competition... They either need to significantly lower their prices,or drastically improve the quality of the hotel and its rooms.",2,0,0,False,23,524,0.1164113106240921

Like the previous reviewer said, it goes up a long and winding road. The only bar you could walk back to is from the hotel bar [a pity]. The hotel was partially outdated, some parts were freshly painted and new carpeting but the bathroom had not been remodeled in some time, which doesn't bother me, but what does, is that they weren't maintained very well. One of the bedspreads had crayon still on it. 

It came with a mini-fridge.

The breakfast bar [which also doubles as the hotel bar] wasn't much: powdered eggs, sausage, juice, make your own waffles, toaster, bread, bagels, oranges, jams, and coffees, oatmeal packets. Bagels did the job for me. 

The place was pet-friendly, although there were 2 dogs across the hall that barked for some of the night, driving my dad crazy. Next room over, I was the heavy sleeper and didn't care. On the plus side, there's an indoor pool, free wifi, and a mini-fridge in some of the rooms including ours..

This was the cheapest place I could find with a room that could accommodate all of us (me and youngest in the King bed - it was Mother's Day weekend, and I claim the big bed!; middle son and oldest on the pullout sleeper sofa). Plus, it had an indoor pool/hot tub with which to keep the youngest two occupied. The location (immediately off I-376) was close enough to where we were going to be hanging out (The Waterfront in Homestead) and also conducive to taking their little happy asses back home.

We got there about 4 PM and to get to the hotel, you have to go up this very steep, curvy hill. One thing about Pittsburgh - they can build anything on a hill. Upon checking in, it turned out we arrived at the same time the people from the wedding reception did. It also appeared that most of them were spending the night there too. Joy.

The hotel is considerably old - I think the carpeting is a lovely burnt orange from the 70's, with distinct brown spots that may either be designs or blood stains. I'm not sure which. There are three sections to the prison....er, hotel - A, B, and C. We were in the C-section (ha!) on the first floor, which had a little patio that faced woods. It's weird - none of the levels really match the building next to it, so what was the first floor of one building was the second floor of the other building. Tres confusing.

Upon entering the room and leaving the sketchy hallway, I was happy to see that the rooms were up to date. I was not amused to see that the television was on - I wasn't quite sure I was in the right room or if someone else was there. Luckily, we were the only people who were supposed to be in there. The hotel has WiFi and the room had a mini fridge; the one thing that it didn't have was a lot of outlets, especially any around the bed or the computer desk. We had to unplug most of the lights in the room so that we could run two laptops and two PSP's.

We went out for the evening and came back around 11 PM, only to find all of the well lit parking places taken. We had to park pretty far from the door, and it was in a dark area that was surrounded  by woods. Nothing screams ""target!"" like a single woman with small kids. We  made it to the hotel entrance okay, and I'm writing this review, so I am assuming we were all unscathed.

The bed was very comfy and the pillows were fluffy. The bathroom left a lot to be desired. Little room, if any, to navigate in there. Basically the toilet is almost IN the shower. It is also very low to the ground, so you're sitting with your knees up by your ears almost. The previously documented bottle opener was also right at eye level as you were sitting. That weirded me out.

Offspring and I went to go get our complimentary breakfast so that we could take it down to the pool and eat poolside before they went in. What a cluster***k! There were almost 100 people in that restaurant, and most of them were of Indian descent, all screaming at each other, and cutting in front of people just to grab stuff. I am lucky that we made it out of there with two bowls of cereal and a piece of sausage. 

The pool is very large, and it was nicely heated (although the pool area itself was cold as all get out). Kids will like it - it's a pool. Adults should be fine with it. I took advantage of the hot tub - I sat on the edge of it with my legs covered up to my knees in water because it was so cold in there and I read a book. 

All in all, we lived. Would I stay here again? Most likely not. There are other hotels in the area that were about the same price range, with the same amenities, and less sketch factor. But, if all you need is a place to stay and you're fine with the above, then this place should suit you fine.

Don't get me wrong--I enjoy this park, but there are some aspects that preclude me from awarding it a 4.  The main reason is that, as another reviewer mentioned, this park isn't the most conducive to pedestrians in the section between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge.  In that section, there is at least as much road as there is path, and if you're on foot or bike, you have to cross it at at least one point.  This section also isn't as scenic as it could be, due to the presence of the wharf (though I'm sure I'd appreciate that aspect of the park more if I had a boat).  Finally, the cool little section with the gazebo that Chelsea S. took a picture of is prone to flooding if the water level's high, which makes it unusable and less than picturesque.

Having said all of that, this park definitely has some redeeming factors.  First, as I already mentioned, the bike trail runs through it, which is great, and is definitely more scenic than it is on the other side of the river.  Second, the section down by South Side Works is quite nice, and offers a great view of the Mon.  Third, the park has picnic tables in both the sections between 17th St. and the Birmingham Bridge and at South Side Works, which make for a great opportunity to enjoy a picnic in view of the river.  Finally, the city seems to be working its way down this park from the Hot Metal Bridge installing improvements--the latest of which is a new marina next to South Side Works.  It's clear that they have a master plan for this park, and the improvements definitely have improved the park, as is evident in the South Side Works section.

Overall, this park provides some much needed green space in the South Side, and is a boon to its residents and cyclists enjoying the trails.  However, there's no comparison between it and the larger parks in the city, such as Frick and Schenley, or even Highland Park.  It'll be interesting to see how things shape up in the next couple of years, as the city continues to improve it.  3.5 stars.",11,5,10,True,8,406,0.14840650820314188

When you walk upstairs to the main dining room, nothing jumps out at you except for standard, basic, run of the mill. Typical cafeteria chairs and tables. 

One day the ""lunch crew"" was looking for a burger and we gave the ""MitchBurger"" a try. Needless to say we have never ordered anything else since. In the basics of a good burger and sandwich, this burger hits all of the basics, with a few problems that they have since changed. Let me breakdown the construction of such. 

A few pros and cons. Cons. They used to put the lettuce on the very bottom, which with a hot burger would make the lettuce wilt and become slimy. And thats it for the cons. 

The Pros. The burger itself is not frozen or pre formed. It has that rustic hand made look. The bacon is thick and crispy and the pepper jack cheese provides a nice heat and texture. The onions are red and sliced into thin rings. I opt for no tomato. And then they add this magical ""mitch sauce"" consisting of a hot sauce / ranch blend. Just a filling burger that hits all of the right notes. 

Downsides to the Mitchells experience are small but are important in any restaurant review. 

When you ask for a water with lemon, ask for extra extra lemons because the portion provided are extremely small. 

The french fries included with sandwiches can be hit or miss depending on how under or over cooked they are. 

Other then that, we are able to always get in and out and back to work on time feeling very satisfied!",1,0,0,False,30,295,0.07553666667434702

The service was quick and wonderful. Our waitress was a sweetheart. My only complaint is the cigarette smoke leaking in from the bar side. 

As for food, I got to try the chili, Mitchburger and original fish sandwich. The best entrée on the table was the burger. It was packed with flavors and bacon. I wish they allowed the option to request it medium rare, instead of coming out fully cooked. The chili was a bit bland, even though thick with meat. I suggest adding a pinch of Cajun and a pinch of salt then it'll be perfect. The fish sandwich was HUGE, but came with nothing except two buns. I suggest slapping on some sauce and dress it up with lettuce/tomatoes. It was so dried without any sauce and plain old ketchup just doesn't cut it. Add a special house blend sauce that's creamy with a spicy kick, then that'll be 5-stars worthy.

They knocked their first Paint Nite out of the park.

I've consistently been treated well at jiffy lube franchises in this state and others, but this location is phenomenal.

I've always been greeted in a super speedy manner and with a smile.  That sounds dorky, but when you dread routine errands like getting your oil changed, it's nice to not have to hate this errand quite so much.

I've come here a few times to have my oil changed, even my tires rotated and they can put on wiper blades at comparable prices to chain auto parts store!  Saves me a trip!

The staff is always so, so nice and polite.  And willing to help.  They've sat and watched me price check other things against competitors before I made a decision.  All while being so cool to work with.

I'm 34, I've gotten my oil changed since I was 16 in like a million places.  Heck my partner can change my oil if I want him to.  Nothing compares to how easy, price-amiable, and smooth this location runs.  

It's came in the other day to just have a simple oil change, needed up with a really cheap tire rotation, they didn't haggle me on upselling a million things I didn't need, and the staff both in the garage and at the desk were so nice.  I hate that I have to point that out but at this time of year it's welcome.

I had a 50% off coupon from another Jiffy Lube (Cranberry). I asked ahead of time (Cranberry) to make sure they still accepted the coupon, he said that they change colors, but the codes are always the same, so they don't really expire. Great, right...Nope. I go to this Jiffy Lube (McKnight). First, they take my car and start the oil change (just the exterior stuff) before anyone talks to me. Then, they accuse me of making the coupon, or copying it, or something saying that they don't come in green. Then, he claims it is expired! (There is no expiration date ANYWHERE on the coupon, I checked before driving all the way there.

So, after arguing with the guy, I decide I want my car back. He goes and gets the manager (all the while they are still doing stuff to my car). I tell the manager I want my car back. He goes back out and talks to the first guy again, and one of the mechanics comes in the office, grabs another 50% off coupon and says, ""just give her this."" Manager comes back and says, ""the best we can do is 25% off, that's a pretty good deal."" 

At this point I am thinking that they are probably going to use the 50% off coupon and pocket the difference, but who knows really? I again tell them I want my car back. He says something about them already starting. I say I don't care, I want my car back. 

After some additional arguing, they finally give me my car. Then the manager comes and stands at my window while I am calling my mom. So, I'm like, yes? He proceeds to tell be again that 25% is a good deal, and blocks my way forward out of the parking lot.

At this point I did 2 things, 1. checked to make sure that my pepper spray was in the compartment in my door and 2. asked for his name. So, Alex, if you are out there, you are a jerk. You used your position to try to intimidate me into getting an oil change I didn't want, really, why? who does that? 

LADIES, for your own safety (just my opinion, but I didn't feel safe) do not go to this Jiffy Lube.

Taste: Yum! Tried croquettes for the first time and they were so darn delish! It's shaped like a oblong doughnut and stuffed with chicken pot pie filling and dipped in a white gravy that tasted just like KFC's version!

So it was a Saturday night and I hadn't had a good wing in a while so we decided to try Mohan's again as they have been voted best wings in Penn Hills every year for as long as I can remember. Their menu has all of the usual suspects, burgers, salads, sandwiches, wraps and much more but the undisputed star of the menu has to be the wings! They are whole wings and they are HUGE!

It had been years since we visited so much to our surprise we saw that they have expanded and more than double their space. We were quickly seated and had our drink orders taken.

For our meals my wife went with the four piece fried chicken dinner which came with two sides. She choose a salad and cole slaw. The dinner also comes with a small basket of bread and butter. Our daughter got a burger and fries. No surprise there. 

I of course got the 6 piece wings with spicy ranch dressing on the side. I also got the potato wedges with cheddar and bacon on them. The wedges were delicious and cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft and warm on the inside. Now when I tell you that the wings were old the chain, they were of the chain. Nice and big with a nice crispy skin and hot and juicy inside. These are by far the best wings in Penn Hills and dare I say the entire eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh!

Long version: 
I ordered two $1 sandwiches and two $1 large drinks last night (receipt says the transaction occurred at 9:57 PM). The cashier wiped her mouth with her right hand, and began panicking because she tasted something disgusting on her hand. She began licking her shirt to wipe off her tongue and proceeded to wiper her mouth again with her other hand as well. She was in the direct line-of-sight of the store manager and other employees (who were loudly joking and cussing at the time). 

I figured that, while this was unprofessional, this would probably not be a big deal because surely someone else would make my drinks or she would surely wash her hands or put on gloves before handling food. 

I was incorrect. 

The cashier, within close proximity to the store manager, proceeded to grab two drink cups, held them by their rims with her fingers touching the inside of the cups, and made the drinks I ordered for myself and my wife. The manager, seeing this go down, did not intervene. 

Once filled, she then placed the cups on the counter. 

Needless to say, I threw those cups away. I called corporate this morning. They said the owner's association in charge of that McDonald's should likely be calling me in the future (but this is the third time I have made a complaint against a McDonald's in Pittsburgh and no one has ever contacted me). Additionally, for some reason Pittsburgh's McDonald's has the least professional workers of any McDonald's I have been to. I have eaten at three different locations (East Liberty, Oakland, Downtown) and not-once was the place operated well (i.e., there were unsanitary conditions or unprofessional staff at all locations). 

If these kinds of things are not dealt with when they occur in front of customers and the store manager, I can only begin to wonder about what else is going on behind the scenes; what other sanitation issues occur out of customer's views? 

I was also not offered a refund or replacement for the two drinks that were ruined by the unsanitary worker.

The lady said walk ins only when I asked about appointments. I called again the day before asking if someone would be there to do the airbrush and she said she didn't know and would have to ask her manager and call me back. I said not to worry about it, we will take our chances. We get there,my husband and I, and she says we could have made an appointment for the airbrush instead of using the booth.  I let her know that was never mentioned in the phone calls. My husband is a body builder and needs a spray tan that is very very dark for his competition. Because no one is there to do the airbrush and we didn't know an appointment was an option, he did the spray tan booth and got the double dark solution. Right away he noticed it wasn't dark enough, not even close. Honestly, we were irritated and rude about it. When I called the lady a week prior she said it would be very dark. She called her manager asking about other options for us and figured out a solution. She was handling our attitude very professionally wanting to help anyway she could. She said it would get darker over night. Honestly we didn't believe her. Well he woke up the next day and was very dark like she said. It was perfect for his competition but probably too dark for someone who wants that nice glowing tan.

I gave 4 stars because the lady behind the counter (unfortunately I can't remember her name) was very professional and did everything she could to make the situation better for us even though we didn't have the best attitude. I would have hated us as customers. 4 stars also because the tan was very dark and she was right about it getting darker as the time went on.

I started coming to this salon for their VersaSpa booth after my last go-to salon closed, and after an amazing experience in a VersaSpa booth back in my hometown.  The price was right, since I was able to snag a BOGO 50% off coupon on the Anytime Tan website.  My tans always turned out beautifully... I had noticed some spotting/sputtering from the machine a few times, but it always seemed to even itself out and was not noticeable on my skin the next day after showering.  I continued to come here and purchase tans because I was satisfied overall with the tan, the cleanliness of the salon, and the pleasant staff.  Last October, I showed up for a spray and was informed that the VersaSpa booth was out of order.  The girl at the desk told me I could go to the location on Route 51 and they would be able to transfer one of my tans over.  This was perfect, seeing as this was closer to where I lived and I really wanted a spray tan before jetting off to California the next day.  

My experience at that Anytime Tan was uneventful, the tan was great; I didn't notice any of the spotting like my tans from the Mt. Washington booth.  Although it took the girl at the desk a little bit of time and a couple of phone calls to the Mt. Washington location to figure out how to deduct a tan from my account (since these locations are independently operated), I left feeling tan and satisfied.

Fast forward to last week, the day before my birthday. I knew I had one tan left on my account at the Mt. Washington salon so I called ahead to make sure the booth was up and running. The girl at the desk said yes, so I made my way there.  Now, I will preface the rest of this review by explaining this:  the VersaSpa tans I purchased consisted of the prep (4 sprays), the color (4 sprays), and the hydration (4 sprays), each of which are followed by blow dry passes.  I entered the booth on the most recent visit, pushed the green button like always, and the session began... unfortunately, the machine only did 4 sprays, sprays I'm not even sure of what they were, before saying ""Your session is now complete. You may now exit the VersaSpa booth"" or whatever that lady says. So was that prep? Color? Hydration?  I got out of the booth, redressed, and walked to the front desk.  The girl at the desk could tell something was wrong just by my face, and I tried explaining what had happened (or rather, didn't happen).  My skin was the exact same color as when I walked into that place, just a little sticky from whatever was sprayed on it.  Normally, when the machine works properly, I'm noticeably darker immediately after the session,  

I asked her to make sure she input exactly what I had on my previous sessions, and she confirmed that she had.  This whole time, the booth is whirring away in the other room and sounds like it isn't finished yet. So I proceed back to the room, undress, get BACK in the booth, and attempt to press the green button and maybe kickstart the next phase.  Nothing.  The machine is still whirring, but the cleaning cycle hasn't started yet, which I found odd considering it usually kicks in before I can get dressed and exit the room.  I got out, put my clothes back on, and walked back to the lobby.   I expressed my frustration to the girl at the desk, but she was unable to offer any solution or even an apology.  I left the salon and went home to do my foolproof DIY spray tan that I got at Sally's for $8. 

I still don't even know what I ended up getting sprayed with, but I'm glad I didn't end up looking like Ross Geller. I just wish the owner would reply to my email that I sent immediately after leaving the salon, requesting a credit on my account for another tan.

First experience BAD!  I called ahead of time to get the scoop on how to prep.  I swear to you the chick on the phone told me to moisturize.  I thought that was weird because I had heard you're not supposed to put lotion on before you spray tan.  Well, I figured maybe I'm out of the loop, so I did it.  I went in, got sprayed and... Disaster!  I looked like I had chicken pox.  My one whole arm was the color I barely recognized.  Have you ever seen that Friends spray tan episode where Ross gets a spray tan on level 4 like 4 times on one side?  That was me!!!

So I came out, the chick took one pitiful look at me and was like, we'll give you another go round.  I was so ""burnt"" from this horrible experience I figured I'd take a week off and try again.  So the week came and went and I made SURE not to lather up with anything!  

I went in, spray spray spray... didn't look like I had chicken pox again and showed up a couple hours later with a pretty decent looking tan.  I wouldn't say I look dark, but it's a nice base from my ghostly pale skin before.  My hands are orange though, I will warn you.  I'm interested to see how long it will last (I'll be sure to update!).

There was a sign stating $30 unlimited tanning which is a great deal. I inquired and was immediately told the $30 was after you paid $99 fee for the year. Different monetary amounts were later thrown out to me which further confused me. Needless to say I didn't join. I just wanted to tan, I didn't want to join a club. Clubs and such are why www.meetup.com was created. I just wanted to lay in a tanning bed for 15 minutes for some peace.

Now I did buy 1 session which cost almost $10. The beds there are amazing. I have to say it probably was the best single tanning experience I've had.

I did not realize this place was located in Scott Town Center. I stopped in the other day and made an introductory apt for a facial. The staff was extremely nice and was able to get one fairly quickly. After completing the necessary paperwork I was taking into a semi dark lounging area while I waited to meet with Felicia who would be working on me. In the small lounge they have a sweet aroma burning to get you into the relaxing mode.

I met with her at my prescribed time. This place is small so there are no changing areas outside of the room you are assigned to. Once changed I got under the blanket and she surveyed my face, neck, and shoulders for problem areas and advised treatment. I did find the table I was laying on a bit uncomfortable at first but she put a knee roll underneath to help me feel more comfortable.

She explained every aspect of the treatment she was doing and what purpose it served. Although the facial focuses on the head and neck she does do some light shoulder work to help soften the tissue. It felt very soothing and comfortable and before I knew it my 60 minute session was over. She left the room again so I could dress and look at myself in the mirror. She also gave me a sample cream to use on my problem lips that always seem to be chapped and want to peel.

Evolve offers both the facial and a massage at an introductory rate which is about $20.00 off the normal rate. Let me say this, I've never had to pay less than $100.00 minimum for such a fantastic treatment. You add the amount of your tip when they bill you before leaving. I booked a return visit in May and will be scheduling a massage in the near future.

They carry their own product line if you wish to purchase anything. You're paying roughly the same amount that you would at one of those high end stores such as Nordstrom's. What's also nice is that you can purchase a membership which like a gym will deduct the amount from your card on file so you can save about $20.00 on either a massage or a facial.

Another option they give you is a prepaid package which ranging from 3-12 months which entitles you to the same choices. It at least gives you the chance to alternate from one to another. Gift packages are available as well which will be the right choice for me to give my friend.

Please note that their services can be either 60 or 90 minutes and priced accordingly. They have their own website so you can understand completely their policies and book from the comfort of your own home. 

They also offer specialty services such as waxing or special treatments for an additional fee. Be sure to check with the person you are working with.",16,7,16,True,40,528,0.08819787041266758

I moved to Pittsburgh 2 years ago and had to break up with my amazing masseuse who honestly changed my life and overall wellbeing. Can you believe she wouldn't move to Pittsburgh?! Rude. 

Anyways, since then I have been to half a dozen different places in Pittsburgh in search of finding a place that met my standards of the ""perfect massage"". It sounds petty, but this is the one treat I indulge in and I don't want to waste my money.

After reading reviews on Yelp I booked massages for myself and my boyfriend. The location was easy to find and plenty of parking was available. I met my masseuse, Brendon, and I immediately felt relaxed by the tone of his soothing voice. 

I told him what areas were bugging me and he got to work. I told him I wanted deep tissue and he did NOT disappoint. It was definitely the best massage I have ever had. Brendon also told me to breathe on occasion because he probably could tell I was nervous. After the massage he gave me tips for stretches for my problem areas. 

My boyfriend had Ashley and said it was the best massage he had ever had! 

The only issue is that they aren't closer to my house, which is at no fault to Evolve. This locally owned company has affordable pricing for those who want to incorporate massage into their wellness routine. The front desk staff was kind and friendly, and didn't make you feel rushed. 

Honestly this is probably one of the best kept secrets, and I am so glad I found it! I will definitely be returning.",1,2,1,False,35,288,0.08483270802827898

My sad story started with a pretty horrible Brazilian wax job there. It wasn't bad in terms of it not turning out looking/feeling okay after, but the whole process was literally very painful. I was used to getting waxed within a 20 minute span from other places. This wax took well over an hour. While I am at fault for not letting the biz know how bad it was, I never went back for another wax after torturing myself twice with the same waxer.

I had an inkling this was just a specific person and not the biz fault. Plus, I was happy to hear said waxer had left. I scheduled a facial with Dawn and she couldn't have been sweeter. I loved how much info she gave me on my skin and what she was doing. Plus, it was just enough chat time vs relax time. 

You can get a special first time new customer deal for $59, which they were nice enough to give me, even though I'd been there before.

Once we got to the room, she went over the massage, asked me questions on preferences and whatnot and left for me to get ready. The room as warm, dimly lit and extremely calming. The massage right from the get-go was phenomenal. Megan was hands down the best masseuse that I have had in the level of professionalism that she provided, and the technique and pressure. She was spot on. My only complaint was that the vessel in which the hot stones were heated in was rather noisy/clunky when she would have to put stones back in or take out.

Booking the appointment was very easy, and everyone I spoke with was friendly and accommodating. It was my first facial, and Chelsea performed the service. She was professional and welcoming, asked questions about skin issues and any preferences I had. The facial and arm/shoulder/neck rub were all very soothing. She kept me informed of what she was doing, and let me choose whether or not I wanted to do extractions. I opted in, and while not exactly comfortable, they were also not painful. I would do them again at another facial, since the reward far outweighs the discomfort. I felt like I was in control the whole time, and if I had wanted to change steam/exfoliator/extractor I could have (but I didn't, they all were at good levels for me). The products used had a pleasant, though astringent, odor. If you are in the mood for things that are fruity or organic this may not be the best option. I enjoyed it, but others may feel differently.
Things that were nice: pleasant and clean decor, personalities, facial itself was very relaxing and enjoyable. Appointment availability was great.
Things I would have changed: the music was a smidge loud, and while mostly relaxing it sometimes changed tracks or instruments in a slightly jarring way.

They give you a large serving which was really enough for two people.

I'm not fond of sweet main courses so probably would try something different. It came with steamed rice, and thankfully they didn't give me an over generous quantity of the rice.

Note #2: They also offer a small selection of Thai entrees. 

Another trip out to this end of Mount Lebanon resulted in a take-home meal from this tiny, scantily-decorated, almost-nowhere-to-sit Chinese restaurant, and the results were fairly middling. 

A obligatory helping of fried dumplings, that appetizer Kay and I cannot get enough of,  began this insurance seminar of a dinner. They were doughy, somewhat stingy in terms of pork filling, and overall, were unexciting. 

I came close to ordering Thai, but decided against it since I wasn't eating at a Thai restaurant, so I randomly went with an item called Capital Chicken.

A rank-and-file dish centered around battered, fried chicken breast strips, a slew of vegetables and a ""brown"" sauce ""complimented it, leaving my palate bored. 

This is why I'm tiring of Chinese or at least the ""Americanized"" variety:  Everything I seem to order of late contains a protein, a sauce, and some vegetables in some sort of mildly-differing configuration. No matter how exotic it sounds, it turns out to be something I've had before under a different name. 

I want something new in my Chinese excursions. Castle Place doesn't have it. 

Perhaps I should have just stuck with General Tso's. It may not be authentic (who cares?), but I'll be damned if it isn't universally good no matter where I have it. That's what I get for trying to be adventurous: Capital Chicken.

I was fortunate to have Rachel as my stylist. I made only a few remarks and she knew exactly what I was after. Her experience and expertise were immediately evident and she was clearly a natural. I felt really good about the cut after she was through, but it's always a little hard to tell in the moment. I usually don't know until I get home or wait until the next day. When I checked my hair out later on, I was really impressed with how well it turned out. I usually have to make a few minor adjustments myself, but this time there was nothing to be done. It was just perfect. 

Also, she used a shampoo and conditioner on my hair by Surface, which I hadn't heard of before, and they were really quite good. I would have definitely bought them if I lived in the area or could have taken them with me in carry-on luggage on my flight.

While gutter cleaning is straightforward enough, unbeknownst to us our service technician used to be a roofing contractor and installed gutters professionally. He pointed out several places along our gutter where the installers did not properly secure the gutter, and as a result water was dripping down from the roof and fell down through the little opening in between the unsecured gutter and the roof. He then took out his power tools, got back on his ladder, and walked around our house to screw in all areas where our gutter was coming loose. He further made a comment that our gutter looks pretty new and in good shape, it's just that the installers didn't do a very good job and cut some corners that he personally would not have cut.

They didn't show up for the first appointment, and I had taken off of work to be there, so I lost income. I made a second appointment, and they showed up 30 minutes early. Because I wasn't home yet, they left. I called the technician to ask if he would come back. He said he would call me back, but never did. Again, I lost income from work.

They finally came out on time the third time. The windows were still dirty and streaked after they left. They cleaned 30 windows in 50 minutes (including moving the ladder and climbing up and down). That's a little over a minute per window, and most of my windows are the old fashioned kind with several small panes. Not enough time to do a good job.

They did not clean the gutters very well at all either. The one gutter I can reach was still full of leaves after they left. I pulled out 3 handfulls of leaves from that gutter alone. I can't see into the other gutters, so I don't know whether or not they cleaned them. 

They also broke branches off of two of my ornamental bushes, and trampled my flowers.

When I complained, the manager was argumentative. She said the technician told me I had a ""film"" on my windows that made them hard to clean. He never told me that. She said the debris that was still in my gutter was ""shingle dust"". When I told her it was leaves, she still claimed they had cleaned the gutters. 

I asked to speak with the owner. The manager said the owner was on vacation and would call me when she returned. I waited 2 weeks and she never called. I finally got her to call me and, when she did, she knew nothing about the job, she hadn't even talked to the manager to get the history before she called me.

I discussed everything with her and she said she would send the technician back to re-clean the windows and gutters. But she denied responsibility for the damaged bushes and flowers, and claimed that someone else must have done it (even though I went out to water them the day before her workers came, and they were not damaged).

When the technician came back to re-clean the windows and gutters, he apparently took pictures of my house and left. I never knew he came. He told the manager he was at my house for 30 minutes, ringing my bell, knocking on my door, and yelling in my windows. A ridiculous claim - why would I not answer the door? He did not ring my bell once. He took the pictures to prove to his boss that he came to my house, but he never re-did the work.

I emailed the owner that the technician lied about all of that, but she never responded, they never called to reschedule the work, and so I never got what I paid for.

She said she would have them back out to clean them ASAP, which I was happy about, but I don't think they really ever did clean them properly.

This was the first time he was visiting since I moved into this home, so I wanted everything to be perfect.

I called to see if they could come before my son's arrival and was thrilled they could accommodate me.  We had an unusually brutal winter, and when the window cleaners came out, they decided it was too cold to do the job. The water/cleaning solution was freezing on contact.  They came back within the week to do the job and completed it, even though the weather had not let up.  I questioned them doing it that day, but they assured me that it was fine.

I pointed out a couple of windows that still looked dirty and was told by Shawn and his partner that if they had to do anything above and beyond squeegeeing the glass, it would cost an additional $10.00.  Really?  I paid for window cleaning and if you have to actually clean the window I have to pay you more?

Fast forward to last week when we finally had some sunshine.  I was mortified when I saw how dirty and streaky the windows were.  I called the company and left a VM - my call was returned the next day.  I was told that since there was so much time since the job, there was nothing they could do.  The person was pretty curt and told me that I could purchase another package for them to come out again. Why would I hire them a 2nd time when I wasn't pleased with the 1st job they did?

Memorial Day weekend was the first three day period of nice weather we've had so far this year to do gardening, putting the screens back in and all of the other chores you put off.  They looked worse than I thought.  There were dried spots from the cleaning solution on the window sills and I could actually draw into the dirt that didn't come off with a quick squeegee job.

I can assure you the dirt that is on these windows is not from the time that elapsed since the cleaning.  I am including pictures for your reference.  To be fair, most of the windows were fine - these are the ones we would immediately be looking through - the sliding glass door, kitchen and family room windows.  Our bedroom windows, which had the shades and curtains drawn until last week due to the cold, were pretty bad.  Our side bedroom window which I asked about when the cleaners were there and the dining room (which we don't use to eat) windows, were horrible.  

They have a 100% guarantee on their website. I was told that if I called them within the first couple of weeks they would have come out.    The weather was just as bad if not worse in the following weeks, therefore it wouldn't have made a difference anyhow.     

I called the company yesterday and left another VM requesting that someone come out in person so that they could see for themselves what a poor job their company had done.  I wanted to give them the opportunity to make things right before doing a review.  Again, the company returned my call within a day and I was told the same thing.  They would not do anything because of the time that had elapsed.  I was offered a real deal - the livingsocial.com pricing, even though I didn't have a coupon, so they could come out again.  I do not consider this a deal and couldn't believe they weren't interested in seeing what my complaint was.  I'm sure if someone saw this in person, they would have apologized to me and cleaned the windows in question.

I would not recommend this company for window cleaning.  I did not use any of their other services, however, if it's anything like the work I had done, I wouldn't recommend them for any of those either.",11,1,1,False,3,683,0.07448797723897849

We wanted a gutter cleaning ahead of the winter and in preparation for some gutter repair work. The worker who came to the home went on the roof stepped through a portion of the roof he had been warned to avoid and threw debris from the gutters onto automobiles in the driveway. Along with the debris he threw away some of the mesh coverings of our gutter guards. 

Also, upon inspection it was clear that he hadn't done a complete job - there were several spots where debris remained. Another contractor doing home repair said was on the roof for about 5 minutes. 

When confronted with the problems the worker did give a 10 percent discount on the work - but was also defensive and rude. It also wasn't clear to us at the time the extent of the damage on the roof and the work that hadn't been done (we hadn't gone up to inspect further and we later found the mesh around other parts of the yard). 

We e-mailed and called to follow up. Someone who took our complaint promised the owner would respond within 24 hours.

The sandwich was great as well. In retrospect, I should have asked them to cut it in half, but at the same time, it's a fairly messy sandwich, so it worked out to not both be eating a half. Taste-wise, it's a great mix of meat, cheese, slaw, and fries.

This place is not hard to miss, a bright green building is definitely something you can't miss.

I am hoping that Primanti's sticks here.  This space has gone through several businesses already and it's about time that it has a constant business inside.

The decor is kind of a mix of dark and rustic.  Black definitely plays a presence here, maybe they do that to downplay the brightness of the outside of the building.  It kind of gives you an outdoorsy type of feeling inside.  Corrugated metal lines the wall, huge windows for tons of natural light, and there is also an outdoor patio that basically continues the flow in this place.

I went with my old faithful here and got myself the Jumbo.  I am still amazed each time I see the sammich coming at me.

I went here one week after opening early on a Friday evening. The fries on the sandwiches were crispy and piping hot and the veggie burger seemed like it might actually be made in house? Service was speedy and friendly. Good beer selection and happy to see a full bar as well as a larger menu (items like Pizza and salads). There weren't any sports games on so the crowd wasn't very big which is a shame, because I feel like this Primanti's actually deserves the crowd. Despite being a chain of sorts, it does have a local vibe to it and I feel like it's going to do much better in this location than some of the upscale predecessors in this spot. Hopefully the service and quality holds up when they are busier too.

This was once the location of Verde/ Prairie. The Primanti's staff did a great job as this location looks nothing like it did previously and really feels like a Primanti Bros. now. Every bit of useable space has been used to add as many seats and tables as possible. There are also lots of big screens everywhere to help cheer on the Bucs, Pens and Steelers.

On our pass we were given a specific time to arrive which was 6pm. Once we arrived our party of four could barely fit inside as there were quite a few people ahead of us waiting to be seated. About 15 minutes later the hostess asked for our name our party size and told us that the wait would be about 20 minutes. Some people who arrived after us were seated before us because the hostess had asked them for their names before making her way to us which made our wait even longer. 

By now we had been standing around for 45 minutes and still weren't seated. The reason the wait was so long was that people were finished eating and were just hanging out instead of getting up so people who were waiting could be seated. We were offered something to drink while we waited which was a nice touch.

Finally we were seated Alexander our server came to tell us about the food and take our drinks orders. The music was way too loud as we could hardly hear Alexander speak and had to repeat to each other what he had said. He was very green and should have had a seasoned server to show him the ropes first. We had to ask him to refill our daughters glass as it was empty for qit a while.

The adults at the table started off with the Drunk Duck cocktail which was amazing and helped me to quickly forget how pissed off I was with the long wait. Next we chose a bucket of the Spicy Garlic wings which were amazing once we finally got to eat them as we had to flag down another server to get some plates. The wings were nice and juicy and cooked to perfection. 

For our sandwiches my wife and our friend both got the New Yorker which is Primanti's version of a New York Deli sandwich. Our daughter chose the Pitts Burger with double meat and I chose the Black Angus with double meat. I can say with confidence that these were some of the best Primanti Bros. sandwiches we have ever had.

This was this locations first day of service and thankfully for Primanti Bros. this was a test run before the official grand opening on 1/18/17. Once the waiting situation is worked out and the music is turned down I'm sure this will be one of Primanti's most popular locations.",10,3,9,True,1,503,1

The pasta was swimming in a pool of oil - you must see the picture to really believe how terrible it was. Since they were closing we just trashed the whole thing.

Sometimes it doesn't taste all the flavorful, VERY rarely (we come every Saturday). But it usually is very good.

At first i was severly dissapointed in the quality but the manager was very kind and explained they were just closing but were happy to refill anything fresh if we would have asked. So we came back much earlier and it was MUCH better.

The waitress was nice and efficient, refilling our lemonades constantly and finding lemons for me which is a staple in buffets in Michigan.

I, on the other hand, enjoy buffets but only on occasion. Buffets are nice because you can take what you what and try new things, however sometimes when I go out to eat I just want to sit and have somebody bring me my food. 

Last night I caved and agreed to go here to make him happy. Was it bad? No, not really. Was it good? Ehh, I've had worse. The best way I can describe this is really just your typical run-of-the-mill Chinese buffet. It's nothing spectacular, yet you'll still be able to find something you'll like. 

As I mentioned in previous reviews, I like the more ""American"" Chinese food like Pineapple Chicken. There is no shortage of this kind of food as they also have a few American dishes like fried shrimp, chicken bites and onion rings. One thing I enjoyed was their coconut shrimp. It was probably one of the best I've ever had. It was unusually creamy (in a good way) and had a sweet taste that wasn't too strong. 

The biggest disappointment for me was their crab rangoons. Not only was the amount of stuffing extremely unappetizing, but it was way too sweet. I'm not too much of a sweets person so I was turned off. It made me sad because I really enjoy my crab rangoons! That's one food that's usually a guarantee score for me at a Chinese buffet. That being said, all of the food seemed up to temp and watched carefully by the staff.

The best thing I ate was the sweet and sour chicken.  That isn't saying much considering that an easy and fairly bland dish that is.  But the chicken had a good texture and the breading was right.  They had a lot of dishes that I enjoy, but most were dried out or almost empty.  The coconut shrimp looks like it would have been very tasty, but all that remained in the dish were remnants of sauce and one lonely shrimp.   I tried both the hot and sour and won ton soup.  The wonton soup had good flavor, but the won tons were dried out, again probably because they had been sitting a while.  The hot and sour was not horrible but not great either.

But since this shop sits pretty close to the edge of downtown closer to the Monongahela River, it's a more convenient meal option for those of us working in this section of the area.

I've stopped in here a couple of times, both to dine in-house and to grab food to-go so that I could eat in my office. I don't really have a strong recommendation either way - the establishment itself is pretty minimalist: wood tables, tiled floor...There's no harm in chilling here while you enjoy your meal, and there's no big loss if you take your meal to go, either.

Way more important in my mind is what I order, because I love some good food! Here, my meals have ranged from ok to delightfully tasty. Per a coworker's rave review I once ordered a couple ""OMG tacos"". True to their name, those were some big tacos! And the toppings on them were quite tasty. The pork was sweet and juicy, always a good sign; I've had one too many dry pork tacos in my day! Unfortunately, the big strike against this particular order was that while the filling and toppings were all around yummy, my taco shells themselves were soggy. They were not soggy to the point of falling apart or anything - truth be told, if I hadn't just eaten at another taco joint the weekend before, I might not have noticed as much as I did. Alas, I did notice, and unfortunately the slightly mushy taco shells really detracted from the deliciousness that was inside them.

But another time, I ordered a naked burrito - a.k.a. a burrito bowl. This meal was much more to my liking: a bowl piled high with lettuce, rice, beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream and queso fresco. And all of that was topped with a meat of my choice. The lime and salt seasoning made for quite the zesty entree. Just thinking about it makes me want to come back for more...

Though I'm admittedly not a regular here, between my meals here and my coworkers' unanimous love for Taco Town, I know that their menu has some solid options for when I find myself craving some Mexican while at work; plus, given how busy a certain other spot in Market Square is, it's nice to have a less crowded go-to for my burrito and burrito bowl needs!

What's Hot
- Selection/variety.  Not bad!  There are a variety of drinks, sweet treats, mochi, baked goods (swirl cakes, egg yolk buns, read bean cakes, etc...), savory snacks (shrimp chips, wasabi peas, dried mango, etc...), frozen food (dumplings, steamed buns, mochi ice cream), sauces, toiletries, etc...  It's not bad.  Keep in mind, this isn't a large store, so they won't have everything.  For example, they didn't have chili bamboo shoots.
- Prices/Yelp discount.  I checked in on Yelp and got a 5% discount coupon!  My total was around $70, so my discount was around $4.  Not bad! 
- Location.  It's in the heart of Squirrel Hill, which is a convenient location and within walking distance of other restaurants and shops.
- Service.  I asked one of their staff to help me find something, which he was able to do.  Unfortunately, there were only 2 brands of what I was looking for, but he knew where it was.  He also knew they didn't have the chili bamboo shoots I was looking for.  When I showed the cashier my Yelp coupon, she gave me the discount and then pointed out my savings on the receipt.  Their staff definitely try and are helpful.  

What's Not
- More produce.  They don't have much produce, which is also seasonal.  For example, I saw pumpkin, lotus root, Asian pears, and several other items.  I'm not surprised there's not much produce, especially given the size of the store.  It's not the size of an Aldi, Giant Eagle, etc...  It's a small market, even though this place is Panda Supermarket.
- Prices.  My total was a little over $70.  I didn't buy any produce.  I bought frozen dumplings, pickled veggies, roasted chestnuts, fermented tofu, etc...  Keep in mind, these products are not easy to find in your usual American grocery stores.  My point?  It's easy to add up.
- Parking.  It's in town in Squirrel Hill, so parking sucks.  There's street parking and behind some of the shops in their little lots.  But be aware, parking isn't easy, especially during busy days, like the weekends.

Final Answer
Would come back, but not just for the market alone.  Given the hassle of the location, I'd make it a point to go somewhere else in the neighborhood, too.",0,1,1,False,11,388,0.08057849045478364

When I got to the truck there was a bit of a line (about 5 or 6 people in front of me), but the guys inside kept the line moving and kept the food coming quickly.

I ordered their spicy pork bowl and a side of dumplings. The spicy pork was layered with rice on the bottom, lettuce on top of that, a portion of breaded pork, and a ribbon of sauce on the top of everything. I didn't know they put dumplings on the bowl so I was excited to see they actually did.

Cost of the bowl was $10. The rice was the largest portion in the bowl (probably about 1.5 cups) and the pork portion was smaller (maybe 1/2 cup or so). But I found the bowl filling and was satisfied with the portion for lunch. I also had the side of dumplings, which definitely were worth the $4 charge.

As for the taste, the spicy pork was spot on. Spice level was similar to a spicy tuna roll in sushi terms (so a bit of a kick, but not overly spicy). The flavor was just delicious. My only critique for the pork would be to get the slices of pork a bit more crispy. Some of them were a bit on the chewy side.

The dumplings were, in a word, magnificent! The taste was delicious and they were perfectly crispy on the outside. They may have been one of the best dumplings I've ever had.

Another reason I like this location is the customer service! The baristas are wonderful. When you walk in they greet you even when they are busy. They also make an effort to remember names of frequent customer.

When I came into this store I saw that they were selling reusable cups and reusable straws for cold drinks.  I have been working hard to reduce my own waste so I love the whole idea of a reusable cup and straw.  It's pretty simple.  You keep the lid and straw and just hand the cup to the employee when you order.  They make your drink in your cup and give it to you to drink when it's finished.  I like companies who are trying to reduce waste so this made my heart happy.  I ordered a Black and White Iced Mocha with extremely ice.  It was made perfectly.

I helped myself to a modest helping of eggs, home fries, three strips of bacon and a cup of coffee which all came to $7.34... a bit steep I thought for a basic breakfast to go. But the eggs were delicious, the bacon was done just the way I like it (a little chewy and not too crispy) and the coffee was fresh.

It would also be a nice touch if they offered sausage gravy. If sausage gravy was available and the home fries were a little more done, I would be there every morning and this would be a five star rating.

I was pleasantly surprised by the selection in the store. I looked through their jacket, coat and blazer selection for both men and women. I was utterly amazed.

Their items are so expensive for things that are used. When I walked in there was a beautiful couch and I was immediately drawn to it. It was pretty big, one of those ones that wrapped around but did not have any recliners on it. I thought let's sit on it and see. Comfortable but worn would be how I would describe it. Then I look at the price tag, $3,000. I was appalled. I've seen couches like that no one's have have ever used for that price. Who do they think they are charging $3,000 for a couch that was used!

After taking a little tour of the place and looking at the clothes and the rest of the furniture I realize that all of their prices were about that high. I understand that some of the stuff was a little bit better than Goodwill but it was not worth the price. If things are going to be used then they need to be priced as such. And I have no problem buying used clothing or furniture but not when the prices are outrageous. There was a dress that was priced at $25 and didn't even have the belt that went with it. I just ended up sitting on that $3,000 couch and waiting until my friends were done checking everything out.

I'm all for reusing and recycling and making a profit, but I think that their prices we're too outrageous for even me to consider. And if someone is really in need a lot of their prices would be totally out of their range. Even the tables and chairs with scratches and obvious wear and tear were about $200. I don't know anyone who's going to be buying a used table for $200. But maybe I'm wrong.

I might go back just because it's in the neighborhood but I doubt that I'm going to be purchasing anything from them anytime soon.

There is also a small section from their high-end consignment store, Designer Days Boutique.

The rest of the store has a ton of women, men, and children clothing (especially women's).  The clothes are separated by type - women's blouses, women's skirts, women's pants, etc.  They are sort of sorted by COLOR, but you do have to dig a bit for your size because they don't sort by size (hence the 4 stars).

The people who work here are runners themselves and are trained to look at the wear patterns of your old running shoes (if you're already a runner or walker, bring your last pair of shoes!), as well as your gait on a treadmill, to determine what your needs are in a running shoe.  They don't offer computerized gait analysis, but that's pretty much the only thing they DON'T do when they're fitting you for a pair of running shoes.  They're also pretty rigorous about making sure that you're in the correct size of shoe for your feet, which some local places don't take all that much trouble to check.  Plus, you can take shoes out into the parking lot for a brief test run, which I find better than testing shoes on the treadmill (95% of my running is out on the street, so...)

I run about 20-25 miles per week, and I have some biomechanical idiosyncrasies that can easily lead to my getting hurt if I'm not in the right shoes.

I had my wife's car in for a $2,000 repair ($1,495 of which was labor, I might add.  So, they made great money off of my job.  Nonetheless, when I returned the loaner vehicle, they claimed that several minor scrapes and nicks around the plastic bumpers where our fault.  This was a loaner vehicle (with a big white website and phone # decal on the rear windshield) that was dirty and abused when I got it.  I saw the scrapes and dings all over the bumpers (front and rear), but I never said anything because I assumed that they knew.  And it looked minor to me (the type of stuff you typically see on a loaner or low-cost rental car).  It never occurred to me that the dealership that stood to make decent money off of my large repair would also TAKE ME FOR A RIDE with the loaner too.  Of course, I disputed the damage.  How could we have possibly put so many minor scratches and dings on a vehicle in 2 days of local driving and which went on a grand total of 4 errands??!!  I asked the service manager, Josh Gagne, for a report of what damage they had on their records prior to loaning it to me.  He promptly replied, ""NONE!""  This was a loaner car which screamed its status as such with the big white decal on the back.  It had been driven for over 7,000 local miles, had minor scratches and dings, and he said there was NOTHING on their internal reports!  And suddenly every scratch on it was my fault???  That big red flag told me that someone wasn't keeping accurate records at the dealership, and now, I suppose, it was time for someone to pay!!  (I wonder if this is a pattern with them, and if anyone else has experienced similar treatment)???  My only regret (besides going to this dealership in the first place) was not taking photos and/or a short video before driving away with the car (and of course documenting every minor scratch on the paperwork).  But it never crossed my mind to do this.  I trusted this dealership (I haven't had much dealing with them, but I had no reason to distrust them).  I was in a hurry.  I took the car without documenting what I saw.  BIG MISTAKE!  In all my years of renting cars and driving loaner vehicles, this was a first for me; which is why I wasn't prepared for it.  The funny thing is, I didn't even really need the loaner.  We have an extra car.  I just thought it'd be nice to drive another Subaru, as we will be in the market soon.  I saw it as an opportunity to test drive a different vehicle.  By the way, my disagreeing with the service staff didn't go over well.  They were rude, and they persisted in talking openly and loudly about me 10 feet away like I wasn't even there.  I stood up for my position, and asked them to discuss it with me directly (instead of pretending I wasn't there).  This only escalated the situation, and I decided to walk out once I discovered that the service manager was busy with other customers.  I asked that he call me when he was free.  When he called me later that day, he was abrupt, unfriendly, and demanded money immediately to repair ""HIS"" car.  I questioned his customer service skills.  It was clear to me that he got his staff's point of view, but wasn't interested in hearing mine.  He just wanted to extract more money from me.  In the end, I will never understand how this short-sighted behavior benefits the dealership over the long run.  I spent good money at this place.  I was poised to spend more. We will be in the market for a car again soon.  Why take such a harsh position with a customer, and then bully them into paying for minor repairs on a beat up loaner that they're just going to send back out onto the street?  This clearly felt like they were just taking advantage of a customer who they knew didn't document anything before driving off.

I took it to the service garage, where he had me pull it in and the light turned off (typical, right!). He asked ""well what did the light look like?"" In a condescending attitude because I'm a young woman and he apparently thinks I can't tell what a small engine light looks like. He told me ""well since it's off, you can take it home."" I told him no that it comes back on and off the past week and a half and that he needs to plug the code reader in and see what the history says. So after much convincing, he did that and says ""well I'll right the code down for you and you can bring it back if it comes back on.""  I again told him no, I want the engine light issue fixed, I didn't even have the car for a month. Then he FINALLY says that he will take the car in. He calls me later that day to say it needs a new oxygen sensor and that Hyundai has to order it. He had called Hyundai and and it would be in the following week.

Having purchased or leased my first three vehicles from Baierl Subaru and utilizing this dealership for service, I've had varied interactions but mostly positive.  

My parents helped my sister and I purchase a flood salvage from Katrina that was hail damaged as our training car/first car (00 Legacy) in 2006.  By 2011, the persistence of the check engine light and the desperate need for a catalytic converter forced me to trade in that sweet Legacy for an even sweeter 02 Outback that boasted heated leather seats, remote start, and moon roof.  It was rust and general deterioration that made my choice to lease a vehicle in 2016 upon trading in that beautiful fateful car.  I'm currently leasing a 2016 Impreza for less than $200 on a trade in with not too much down.  I had the same saleswoman for the last two vehicles, Beverly, whom I recently learned was leaving the business.  She was patient, worked within my budget, gave me a great trade in price, and put me in a reliable vehicle for years.  

Last year, my car was involved in a wreck while parked at the McKnight Siebert shopping center.  A car went too early making a left onto McKnight from the post office side and was slammed by an 18 wheeler ; the sedan ended up on the front passenger side corner of my hood.  I had no idea until the rickety ride home made me turn around to look at my vehicle as I locked it at home - WHAT?!  So, off to Baierl for a huge repair which, thankfully, Erie covered the brunt of.  I rented a sexy CrossTrek in the interim while my completion took longer than expected.  However, the friendly staff from the receptionist, to the service manager truly made the crappy experience more bearable by being supportive and kind.  A little bit of genuine concern goes a long way.  

Shoutout to Christy who answers the phones for her help and encouragement on a very bad day.  The world needs more people like her!  

Long story short, Baierl Subaru cares more than the average dealership.  The salespeople seem to listen to your needs and try to do best by the client.

He was easy to talk to, always answered all of my questions, and was not pushy or aggressive at all. He showed me cars more than once, we exchanged multiple emails, and phone calls, and I always felt like he was quick to respond and knowledgeable. I would highly recommend asking to talk to him if you are interested in buying a car, but not interested in pushy salespeople. I also contacted another Subaru dealer and am STILL getting calls and emails daily that I can not figure out how to get them to stop. So, Simon is great.

As for the car itself. It's really cool. I got the Crosstrek Limited 2017 with just about everything. I really like the eyesight feature that makes the car seem super safe to me. It tells you if you are going out of your lane, if you are about to back into someone, and it will actually stop you from rear ending someone. It doesn't look bad either. I have yet to drive it in the snow, but I hope that will go great as well.

As for the finance department. This is where Baierl Subaru loses a star. They straight up lied to me. So, I was considering the extended warranty, and the finance lady (Lori) tells me, oh just buy it and you can return it for 100% refund. She then goes through and shows me how much more my loan would be with it, at which point I tell her that I want to put the warranty on a credit card, not on the loan. She says ok, and we do that. So then I decide I don't want the warranty and Lori tells me that I would have to put the refund onto my loan, but not as a payment, just on the back end. So they still get all of the interest for the whole amount of the loan with the warranty. 

Now I know you are thinking, what she said she didnt want the warranty on the loan??? Yeah, thats right, I go back to the paperwork, and Lori put it in the loan anyways and then put the credit card payment as a cash downpayment for the car. Now, I don't know if this makes any difference whatsoever, but it is not what I agreed to (but I did sign the paper, in the 5-10 others she had me sign in quick succession). 

So, Lori tells me that it is not possible to get the refund back on my credit card, and I say then I can contest the charge with the credit card company (this seems fair to me, if they think it is wrong then I don't pay, if not, I pay). At this point Lori backpeddles and says she will call me back.

Later in the day I get a call from Lori that they can put the money back on my credit card, because the paperwork hasnt been filed yet.... (not sure I buy this). Anyways, I have to go back to Subaru and resign all the paperwork and the do issue the refund. 

TLDR: read EVERYTHING they make you sign, and don't believe anything that finance tells you, because they think omitting the facts is the same as telling the truth. Also, if you are on the fence about the warranty and do decide to get it, put it on your credit card so if they try to mess with you, you can contest the charge. Also, Simon is awesome.",4,0,2,True,21,610,0.08739444374232351

I know nobody is perfect and that mistakes happen, but I have been nothing but pleased with my dealings with Baierl Subaru so far. I must also preface that I am a first-time new car owner (well, leaser), so who knows if my opinion may change once I have had service done to my car. So far so good. 

That being said, it can be intimidating walking into a car dealership as both a woman and a first-time car buyer. I did a fair amount of research, and I'd say I was fairly well-informed before stopping into numerous dealerships, but it is still a bear of a process to start looking at and buying cars. In all of my visits, from my first to most recent, the men and women at Baierl have been wonderful to work with and didn't make me feel like an idiot as a newbie to all this. 

Rich Gnipp in particular helped me with everything I needed, from explaining insurance policies, monthly payments, and car features. He is who I have to thank for my 2016 Subaru Impreza. At the time of stopping in, I was deciding between leasing a Kia Soul and an Impreza of some kind. Rich did not have the typical salesman's 'edge'. I never felt pressured or roped into any service or package I did not want; all options and packages were run through very clearly and in no way demandingly. Rich's kindness, friendly demeanor, and excellent explanations of everything in the process pushed me over to the Subaru side (granted, the test drive helped a lot, too!). 

From driving my Chevy onto the lot to driving off it in my new Impreza, I really was quite satisfied with all aspects of the car buying process. To top it off, the dealership is really lovely inside - everything was clean and maintained on the showroom floor. The lot is a bit weirdly laid out, but there's not much one can do about that. 

As far as cons go, I can't say there were many. I had an issue interfacing my (oldish) phone with the Bluetooth/Subaru Starlink technology in my new car, but Rich and one of the service crew members took quite a bit of time trying to help me set it up. I never once felt intimidated or pressured along the way.

Our dealer recently folded due to not selling enough cars. Not a surprise really, they were in a not great location and had some less than pleasant sales folks. But service there was quite good and we were pointed to Baierl by the service manager. I have no comments on this as a car sales location, only on their service department. In my opinion, however, that is the most important part of the purchase.

Some of what I'm going to describe is minor, but some of it is - IMHO - pretty serious. We created out appointment online. The online form is quite good and we were able to be quite specific [change oil, rotate tires, replace rear brakes]. The last item was due to a recommendation from Baierl when we stopped for an oil change a couple months earlier.

In the 3 days prior to the appointment I received no fewer than 3 e-mails, 2 phone calls, a voice mail and a text message reminding me of the appointment. A minor annoyance perhaps, but absurd. I think a rock could get that they had an appointment. I have complained about this, but have had no response.

On arrival it seemed as if our appointment and service request must have been transmitted to them in Chinese. At least that was impression we got from the total lack of comprehension as to what was needed. After multiple repetitions of the original request (you know, the one they contacted me 6 times about), they finally got to work.

Total time for the work was 2.5 hours. That's right, 2.5 hours to change oil, rotate tires and change rear (disc!) brakes. If we had been a walk-in, this would be perfectly acceptable, but not after having an appointment (you know, the one I heard about 6 times). 

We tried to find out if they had done a general check out of the car, which every other Subaru dealer we've ever gone to does, but received no information (48 hours now, still waiting). 

Since the service, however, we've received 3 requests for information on how it went. I replied to the first one with my complaints, but of course have not been contacted by a human. The robocaller though, it's on the stick.

They seemed concerned at the dealership that we give them all 10's on the Subaru survey, but not enough to return my call nor e-mail. So they will get a bad review there as well. In addition, we are trying to find out who the regional manager is to contact them.

The manager got on the phone and asked if he could help. I explained the situation and told him that I still wanted a call from Mr. Baierl. He assured me that he would absolutely call me.

Strike 1: Went into look at a Subaru Outback. Drove and loved the car, sat down with the dealer to talk about pricing. We came to an agreement, but since I was going to purchase the car outright, I needed a couple days to make sure I had my finances in order. A couple days later, and the car was sold out from underneath me with no phone call or anything.

Strike 2: I go back into Baierl Subaru a month later after checking online to find the car I wanted is back in stock. I show them the original price they quoted and ask if they can match it. The sales guy says he can't so I ask for the manager. Manager comes and treats me with zero respect (being very snappy and just outright disrespectful). I play hardball and tell the sales guy that if they can't come down in price then I'll have to walk away (it's a negotiation). Sales guy yells at me and storms out of the office, saying I'm wasting his time and throws my paperwork in the trash. 

Strike 3: I take Baierl's quote and go to another dealer who had the car. They match the price and I ask them to quote me for the Tire Warranty also. Now, originally, Baierl Subaru had quoted me $480 for a 36 month Tire Only warranty and they tell me that this is a deal reserved for their ""VIP members."" Thinking I was getting a good deal, I present the $480 ""VIP special"" Tire warranty to this new dealership. The sales guy at the new dealer shows me the Tire Warranty on Subaru's website. The price on their website was around ""$280"" for the same exact thing. WOW. That's messed up!

As I wasn't sure where I would end up living long term, I decided to only look at leases.  Subaru had an amazing deal on 2013 Imprezas, and there was just one left on the lot when I went to look.

The only frustrating aspect was that a lot of the sales people have NO interest in helping you.  We were ignored for the first 30 minutes we sat waiting to talk to a sales person, and there were no other customers.  There was no convincing, I wanted the only Impreza on the lot.  Finally, a woman came over and said she would help us, she just needed a minute.  She never showed up again.  Fifteen minutes later, a very charismatic man, named Frank Fortunato, came over and helped us.

I didn't even test drive the car I got.  We literally signed a lease so I can't talk much about the ""shopping experience.""  However, the Frank did sit in the car and show me where everything was, and he set my phone and car bluetooth up for me.  That was awesome because I never would have done it myself.  He also told me when to get my oil checked, etc.  Nice touch.

Baierl Subaru is pretty aggressive in their sales (upgrades, service plans, etc.), but I like them.  I did get the scratch protection, but I didn't need anything else.  Frank took me around the service area so I would know where to bring my car, which was awesome.  There is free wifi and coffee and sometimes snacks in the lounge while you wait.

In Baierl Subaru, there was no gauntlet, no dreaded review - my car buying experience was simple, minimal stress and actually quite enjoyable.

Ethen provided incredible internet pricing deals on several models across price ranges for me.

Pat is essentially the epitome of how a car sales representative should be: professional, courteous, and willing to go the extra mile exploring various car model options for the next possible price. As we reviewed model features and my eventual purchased vehicle, Pat made sure if he didn't know the answer to one of the redesigned 2015 Outback's new features he would ask questions or research and not assume.

Garret I have to admit I'm beyond impressed. He is some type of financial wizard with skill sets beyond what I can grasp. I walked into the dealership with a pre-approval letter at a very competitive rate. He beat the rate by almost 2 points and priced warranty options with minimal impact to the overall monthly payment.

I was extremely dissatisfied at this dealership. I went to test drive an Acura TL that was Mayan Bronze; I fell in love with the car on Carfax. I was extremely excited to test drive this car. I had been looking at cars all day, and was in a hurry..so even though I called ahead; I told them that I couldn't be sure what time I would stop by. I had been looking at Acura TLs all over the city.

When I arrived, I couldn't remember who I had talked to on the phone. The gentleman through some names out at me, and I thought I had spoken with Joe. [Later I found out that I had spoken with Jim.] I went to test drive the car, and the 'Check Engine' light was on. I asked why, and Joe said, ""This is a Subaru dealership. I am not too familiar with Acuras. I am sure it is fine. It is just a little light on the dashboard."" I wanted an answer, not to be placated.

When I was sitting in Joe's office, Jim came in to let me know that although I spoke with him on the phone, he was sure that Joe would help me out. Then I heard the gentlemen having a lively discussion outside the office. To me, customer service is everything. Both the gentlemen failed. If you fail in customer service, at least know your product. Fail.

I really wanted to buy this car prior to walking into the dealership. The seat was scratched, the check engine light was on, it had 60K miles on it---and Joe told me they were not willing to go down on price. OK.

The biggest flop of the night I'll get to at the end.  I'll try to review only the food/service experience, which, without anything else, would probably jack up the review by another star, but not two.

The food was good.  The poutine was delicious, but not something I'd go back to order.  My meal (Yellowfin with Shrimp and Scallop:  olive oil crushed potato with garlic rouille, petite nicoise vegetables, black oilve vinaigrette) was...a single shrimp on a dollop of mashed potato, a single scallop on a dollop of mashed potato, and a piece of yellowfin on a dollop of mashed potato.  It was fine.  Aggressively so.  I don't even mind about the portion size, because I'd had a drink (it was good!) and shared the poutine, which is generous.  But fine is not five-star despite how alliterative that would be.  

The waitress communicated most things well to us.  Our food came pretty quickly and she was attentive. 

My wife got the Panisse, which just seemed more like an answer to the question, ""Why don't people make french fries out of chick peas"" than anything else, and a hamburger, which she said was good.

The couple dining with us had the Cavatelli of chicken and Duo of pork.  And both of their dishes seemed fine.  Or so I assume since they ate them.  

The food was average to above average.  The wait staff (bartender) was nice.  Lots of vegan options, which is a nice option of Pittsburghers.  

The restaurant...was FREEZING.  Nobody said a thing.  No apologies or acknowledgements.  Literally every patron was wearing a coat.  One woman seated at the table we ended up taking later was wearing a stocking cap.  

When the waitress seated us I asked for the warmest table in the place...she chuckled and seated us next to two space heaters.  

This was not...""have the thermostat set too low because the kitchen is so hot"" cold.  

This was not...""saving energy (hi mom and dad)"" cold.

This was...""Didn't pay the gas bill so they turned it off"" cold.  

Thank GOD we were there on a 50 degree night.  The space heaters boosted it up to a solid 55 or maybe even 60 inside.  

As I said, nobody mentioned the temperature.  We didn't do ourselves the service of asking.  But it was not normal.

Supper began as a concept restaurant at Federal Galley almost two years back and late spring of this year moved out to establish their own restaurant.

At the helm are Chef Vince and his wife Candace along with a bartender and wait staff. Candace took the time to explain the concept to me. Supper on Penn makes everything from scratch and does not use any processed foods. It is designed to meet the needs of those who are gluten free, vegetarian, vegan, and regular food so that a group of people can sit at a table and enjoy a meal that has something for everyone.

The menu is clearly marked accordingly. The place is small and very clean. Off to the entrance they have a full service bar. At this point they have a limited selection of non alcoholic beverages but that will change as they get settled in. Candace explained to me that the menu will change with the seasons and what was being served today was from their summer menu.

Since vegan places are limited in the Pittsburgh area I decided instead of a hamburger to have the meat free alternative. With it you get a choice of duck fries, salad, or chick pea fries. After speaking with Chef Vince I went with the chickpea fries. I asked him what does he use in preparing a vegan burger. He told me he uses protein based ingredients including quinoa and chick peas and builds from there. 

It took a while to get my food but remembering that it is being made from scratch and cooked to perfection resulted in a very filling and delicious lunch. My vegan burger was made with cheese substitute and sat on an enormous pretzel bun. The chickpeas fries were thick and came with a dipping sauce. Take out is also available as well as containers since you get so much in a meal. I was literally full when I was only halfway done with my sandwich! 

I got the opportunity to chat with some others who visited and learned the falafel pita is one of their most popular offerings. If a sandwich is too much for you then you can order small bites such as seared scallop or stuffed smoked tomato which is their version of a vegan meatball. Gluten free bread is also available for sandwiches. Everyone I had spoken to were pleased with their selections.

The desserts sounding tempting but will have to wait for next time. Among their offerings are vegan plum cheesecake and two regular cakes. They make their own ice cream using liquid nitrogen to ""fast freeze"" the elements. Chef Vince's specialty is the peanut butter flavored both for vegans and non vegans alike. Using coconut milk for vegans a person can order 3 scoops of different flavors.

They serve the lunch/dinner menu everyday except Sunday when they do brunch. Candace also told me that given time they plan to incorporate a breakfast menu. 

The building itself has a history of its own and they've taken the time to renovate it based on its industrial roots. With Edison lights hanging from the tin ceiling to lanterns illuminating each tables one is taken back to the speakeasy days of the early 1900s.

Supper on Penn is located in the 1200 block of Penn Ave just as you have entered the Strip district. It sits near the bus depot and not far from the Heinz history center. Parking can be problematic but public transportation is available and for those who like to ride bikes it comes in handy. It is also a short walk to the downtown area.

Never thought I'd need to have the cops associated with a pizza delivery before, but tonight came close. 

Ordered for the first time this evening for delivery and was patiently waiting for our pizza. Upon the drivers arrival he gave two loud knocks then proceeded to open my front door and say hello, as if he is Kramer from Seinfeld or something. I proceeded to let the driver know that this is completely and utterly unacceptable. Under no circumstances do you open someone's front door as a delivery driver, whether they're waiting for you or not... we then called the establishment to explain what had just transpired only to be verbally attacked, and accused of threatening to shoot this person?! This is 100% untrue and I am completely dumbfounded that they would do react in such a manner.

Mainly because you can have whatever you want delivered to you, or call ahead and do a quick pick up on your way home.  Recently my better half and I were just not wanting to move and wanted to continue our lazy day.  We decided pizza would be a good go to.

Looking up Cerasoli we made a quick decision and called to place our order.  We were told it would take about 20 minutes and our order would be ready.  Being close by that allowed for us to continue to be lazy and leave after a few minutes to get here when our food was ready.

We showed up here and had a few more minutes to wait, but that allowed for us to pay and check out the place.  It is a small pizzeria, but it does allow for eat in if you please.  There are a few tables inside, but I think that if you want to eat in house it might be best to do so in the colder months.  It gets rather hot in here.

Our food was ready and we headed out.  We decided on the Meat Lovers Pizza and two orders of mozzarella sticks.  The mozzarella sticks were your basic item that you can get from any other pizza joint in the city.  Nice coating on the outside with a side of marinara for dipping.  The Meat Lovers Pizza was your almighty pizza.  This thing came topped with pepperoni, sausage, ham, salami, capicola, gyro meat, and bacon.  Also put some mozzarella, provolone, and Romano cheese.  This thing was massive.  Also with being massive, it was greasy to no end.  It made it a bit heavy, but in the end, filling.  I could only eat a few slices and had to stop.  Which isn't all that bad, that meant that I had some for later.  All in all, a satisfying meal for a lazy day of laying around and watching some television.",11,4,8,False,35,338,0.0844420896014445

Last time I tried to order wings for pickup knowing that before that time they forgot my 2 extra toppings that were paid for ! I called when we got the pizza and they said they will credit us the next time we order for the toppings. So when I try and order the wings and explain that I should have credit for my toppings because I wanted to use it I don't believe the guy was understanding that I was trying to say I had already called because he would not let me explain what happened and was very rude and just is always grumpy on the phone. This is no way to treat your customers and if they actually say they're  going to give you credit for something that you paid for and did not get than that's what they're supposed to do.

I wasn't crazy about the seats on the patio, they are quite comfortable, don't get me wrong, but they lean back, which makes engaging in conversation a little more difficult.

They have a wonderful beer selection, and they organize it well, so you can easily know the style of beer and the ABV. 

This place is old school with reasonable prices. Service is excellent, too.",8,3,7,True,19,129,0.08312071574728346

My favorite thing on the menu is there salad with sliced apples or pears and that champagne vinaigrette dressing. Cannot go wrong with this at all it is a delicious salad that will leave you wanting to come back every night for something so fresh and crunchy.

The chicken planks are also top notch. When they are marinated in the bbq sauce...yum. They felt like a meal in itself. I enjoyed trying these.

I tried the meatballs and the bite that I had wasn't bad. I enjoyed it more than I thought I would considering it's not homemade.

Things that I wasn't a fan of include the stuffed pretzel. It is not a pretzel stuffed with cheese it is a pretzel cut in half and the cheese in the middle like a grilled cheese using a pretzel bun.

Also the nachos. I could not get into them. They just were not like any nachos I ever wanted to eat. The salsa wasn't flavorful and the jalapenos were candied and sweet. And the nacho cheese was cold! Not a fan for sure.

I think that the good always outweighs the bad here and as long as you know what to order you will love it like I do!",0,0,0,True,17,238,0.07059964734854106

We got in and pulled right up to 2 stools at the bar.  Katie, the very friendly bartender, came up right away and offered the HH specials and we ordered our usual beer- Coors Lights. This place has a MASSIVE beer list- probably 40 on tap, but you know how it is- you like what you like.

The Lawrenceville version, not so.

I was so excited when I found out the NPL was coming to Lawrenceville. I regularly drive over 30 minutes just to go to the NPL and now it would be in my backyard. We were legit shouting for joy in my house and it was like a dream come true.

What I found out was that it was only the NPL in name. 

The environment: It's kind of a club/bar environment, which is different from the McCandless NPL restaurant environment. Loud music, high bar stools and crappy club tables. Everything is pretty squeezed in and the booths are not for anyone over 200lbs. The McCandless NPL has an older and more family type of crowd, while this is for hipsters and club-goers, of which I'm not.

The prices: The McCandless NPL is expensive and this place is about 5%-10% more expensive.

The food: The McCandless NPL is famous for their ""Lounge Fries"". They attempted to change how their fries were made randomly a few years ago. The new fries were smaller and thinner. The experiment lasted less than a month and everyone rejoiced when the original Lounge Fries returned. Unfortunately, the Lawrenceville NPL got those new Lounge Fries and I was disappointed when I saw those on my plate. They aren't that bad, but it's nothing to be excited about. My burger was similar to the McCandless NPL burger which is always good/

The menu is a little bit different. They have a much smaller menu with multiple items missing. I can't remember which ones in particular, but it's just not the same. 

Overall: I was really disappointed with this take on the NPL. It's an impostor. I'm sure the owners and staff meant well enough and I wish them success, but I'd rather drive the extra 30 minutes and get the real NPL experience at the Mccandless NPL.

As you walk in the store,  it's well lit and we'll taken care of. As you linger towards the back of the store it seems to become less and less organized.  It's almost as though the front sells more and the back sells less so why keep up with it... 

I purchased a curling iron and thought I got the one on sale... I ,of course, didn't but the sale floor staff was very happy to help me find the one I wanted. She had to go in the back to get the right size for me and was apologetic but it took so long.

In trying to abide by the city's trash pickup parameters, I became overwhelmed when I  realized it was going to take me weeks, if not months, to properly & respectfully get rid of everything.  I just decided to look up junk removal and 1-800-GOT-JUNK was one the first companies I came across. They had great reviews on Google and Yelp, so I decided to give it a shot.

I booked my appointment completely online, I did not have to pre-pay, and I was able to get in for the very next morning (9:30 on a Sunday nonetheless)!  The driver gave me a call that they were a little bit behind schedule because of a large job, but they would arrive by 10:00, and wanted to know where they could park. 

When the 2 guys arrived at 9:45, they immediately assessed the 'junk' and offered me 2 quotes depending on how it would fit on the truck- I agreed and they got to work. The only thing they were unable to dispose of were paint cans filled with wet paint (they said if it had dried out, they could, but since it was wet, I needed to buy a hardener or kitty litter to dry it out and then put it out with my other household trash & the city trash people would take it).

They filled up 5/8 of the truck in 15 minutes. It was astounding! They also left ZERO mess in the driveway (a feat since some of the junk was yard logs and other yucky stuff). 

They took my payment info and gave me several options for a receipt, and they were on their way. 

The guys were uniformed, friendly, and very efficient. They were honest about pricing & filled the section of the truck from top to bottom (since you get charged by how much volume your junk takes up, that is very important!)

I would not hesitate to use 1-800-GOT-JUNK again. They quickly and efficiently took my junk for a very reasonable price and all without leaving a mess or making me wait weeks for them to show up. 

I highly, highly recommend them for all of your disposal needs! Seriously. You know you have a ton of junk to get rid of - take the leap and get it done - you'll be amazed at how quick your junk disappears!",4,0,2,True,25,428,0.10162907761751384

Pros: An incredible option for a coffee meeting with a colleague or business prospect during the week. The coffee prices are average and they have some tasty options including their nitro cold brew. This is a great alternative to the small Starbucks that is close by. It can be quiet here before lunch, so it's also a great place to have a coffee and get some work done or study. 

Cons: Not the best lunch casual lunch option. The prices are steep and the portions are small. The food is good, but it's not great enough to justify the high cost. If you are looking for a more formal place to meet a business prospect it can be a great option, but it's not great when you're really hungry and not looking to spend a chunk of change for lunch.

Usually people don't go to museums for their cafes, so I was pleasantly surprised to discover that the cafe was open for brunch and served up a pretty good menu.

For a Saturday morning it wasn't too busy and my friend and I were able to secure a table without a reservation. The staff was cordial and helpful. Our waitress made some pretty good suggestions regarding the menu. Everything seemed delicious and there appeared to be good vegetarian selections as well. 

We took her suggestion and ordered the Bocadillo di Tortilla for $13 and a short stack of pancakes for $7. The name tortilla is a bit misleading: it's actually a sandwich with two thick slices of bread around arugula, manchego, aioli and an egg, spinach, and potato frittata. The sandwich was decent. The crispiness of the bread paired well with the soft frittata. However, it wasn't too outstanding, I'm not sure if I would order it again. It was nice to try it. I would consider it a good experiment as opposed to what I usually order. Although the short stack seemed small it was still quite filling and soaked well with maple syrup. The pancake was soft and fluffy, very satisfying.  The portions were quite generous so we ended up packing up our leftovers.

One of our neighbors was so loud and full of himself he boggled our brains and made us miserable.  We debated getting up and walking up but instead convinced the host to move us instead.

We debated the menu until we saw another diner's vegetable pot pie.  It is so cute!  It's a modest puff pastry box with a lid.  Inside were brussels sprouts, sweet potatoes, pearl onions, and maybe something else.  The sauce was delectable.  It was served with a simple yet flavorful side salad.  The vinaigrette leaned on the side of featuring the flavor and texture of the high-quality olive oil, which was a good thing.

We also enjoyed the grilled sandwich.  This was an umami explosion of broccoli rabe, egg, and bread, with a little sopresata for flavor.  It was served with a slightly different side salad; dressing was more piquant with more emphasis on the vinegar.  This was a good foil for the decadent egg.

We also shared a double-shot cortado, which we felt was on par with what you'd be served in a European cafe.  Yum.  And it was served in a cute glass.

But even during peak times, I usually was able to get a cardio machine, even if it wasn't the one I wanted.

Once a month they do offer ""Free Pizza Monday"" and ""Free Bagel Tuesday"" (actually, I'm not sure if those are the correct days of the week, but you get the idea). I never partook in the free food, since it seems sort of counterproductive. But I regularly saw people come in just for the free pizza with no intention of working out, haha.

This gym is suffering from gym plague which happens to several 24 hour gyms... it simply is over sold. Membership to equipment ratio... which means if you in peak hours (am between 7-9 am or pm between 4-9 pm) you will be hard pressed to find an open treadmill, or exercise bike since there is only a handful of them. 

A lot of the machine and equipment are taking a serious bashing and are out of order from time to time. Including the water fountains. Which were down for over a week period, some days water was offered to patrons at the front and some days it was not. Errrr what gym does not have water?

Its also very loud which I can hang with but the country music playing in the women's locker room has got to go. Things are not as clean as they used to be either... understandable this gym has several more patrons now. But they shouldn't be running out of paper towels and spray bottles for me to wipe down the machines after use. 

Couple that with lack of diversity of workout options here sooooo many stationary weights makes for an over crowded free weight area 89 % of the time. It is just not that comfortable to workout here anymore. I wish they would rid of some of the free weights and either a.) expand the free weights area or b. add a better area for stretching with more mats and workout balls (i.e. medicine yoga etc)",7,4,3,True,17,315,0.14182640503975918

3) It is only $10 a month, but there is a $29 yearly ""maintenance fee"". So be aware. They do not make this clear when you sign up, but it will appear on your credit card statement every year. Granted not a huge amount, but I don't like to be taken off guard with additional fees and the like.

Pros:
1) They have soooo many machines. I go after work most days, so even during that 5-6pm hour I can always find an open machine. The treadmills do get pretty full, but there's usually 5-10 open at any given time, as long as you don't mind jumping in the one open spot between two treadmills in use. (Seems silly to mention, but I've met plenty of people who won't do it for some reason.)

2) There is always space in the locker room. There are also three showers and changing stalls. 

3) The entire place is SPOTLESS. Absolutely, without a doubt the cleanest gym I've ever been in. Even in the locker rooms. 

4) Crowd is nice. It varies a lot, so everyone should really feel welcome here. They're succeeding with making it a no judgement zone, that's for sure. There's old people, teenagers, college students, etc. Very nice mix and everyone I've met is friendly enough.

5) Cheap cooler drinks. Bottled water for $1 (50 cents if you have a black card).

Cons:
1) There are no classes at this gym, just machines. (I only use machines anyway, but I think it's important to note.) Although, you can sign up to do unlimited sessions with a personal trainer (I think it's probably only beneficial for beginners who want to learn how to use the machines). 

2) Weightlifting section is tiny. 

3) Two days a month, they give pizza and bagels. There's a bowl of candy on the front desk, piled high with Tootsie Rolls at all times. I always thought of gyms as being a safe zone when trying to reach health/fitness goals... not so here. With PF as a gym that caters to people just starting their fitness journey, this blows my mind.

No use of yoga or pilates or private equipment is allowed, another PF I attended actually had the yoga /pilates balls which I used to like to use for stretching. Also you cannot bring free weights into other areas which kinda sucks because the free weight space is limited.

My membership is $20/month, and that's for the ""black card"" that gives me reciprocity with all of the other PF locations, nationwide.

Good parts about this gym:

- It is very clean.  No weird smells, no dirt on anything.

- It is usually very empty, so I never have to wait for anything.

- They have a few of my favorite pieces of equipment, such as an assisted dip/pull-up machine, which my last gym didn't have.


Bad parts about this gym:

- I believe that this gym has a business model that consists of encouraging sedentary people to join the gym, then banking that they won't use it.  They have a ""judgement-free zone"" gimmick that actually consists of judging people who use the gym to get in an intense workout.  They have weird signs up about not making grunting noises when lifting weights, and not drinking out of large jugs of water.  Now, I'm no powerlifting champion, but when I'm lifting weights, I'm going to make a noise.  And who the hell cares about how much water you drink, or what receptacle you use to drink it out of?

- The free weight equipment is sorely lacking.  No Olympic bars, no power cages.  If you're going to squat or deadlift, you need to modify your exercise plans and do it with dumbbells instead, assuming that there are heavy enough dumbbells for you to complete your workout.  

- No stability balls or boxes, which makes it hard to do some of the exercises in my program.  I'm going to see if they'll let me bring some in, or if it violates their no-healthy-people policies.

- Overall, this gym seems to actively discourage people who like to exercise.  When I joined the gym, they gave me a size XL T-shirt.  I wear a women's size small.  I asked if they had any smaller shirts, and they said that they did not, because only carrying the largest size of shirt was a part of their ""judgment-free policy"".  I think that's ridiculous, and it sends a message that if you aren't an extra-large person, the gym doesn't really want you.  There is literally an alarm with flashing lights and blaring horn that the staff will press if they think you're putting too much effort into your workout, because apparently it is intimidating to see people who are putting out a lot of effort.  We will see what happens when I move into the sections of my training program that feature very odd-looking compound exercises; the attitude projected by this gym makes me actually concerned that I will get kicked out, despite the fact that I always behave as courteously as possible at the gym.


So, basically, this gym is a really good value at $10 or $20 a month, but it is a pretty bad gym.  If you are a sedentary person who is looking to get active, you might be right at home here.  If you're interested in strength training with free weights, this is not a very good gym at all; if you can afford it, I would suggest a different gym.  Unfortunately, this is the only gym in my general neighborhood that I can afford, and it still (barely) meets my (modest) needs.  If weightlifting is your primary sport, save your money and use a different facility.  You won't be able to get anything done here.",3,0,0,False,4,596,0.15890136039985955

After signing up for that membership about 36 hours ago, I went for my first work-out this morning.  I'm a bit of a night owl, so that involved arriving at the gym around 2:45 AM or so (they're open from midnight on Mondays to 9:00 PM on Fridays and then again from 7 AM - 7 PM each weekend day).  The facility was deserted when I showed up, but a handful of other people filtered in over the next hour or so.  Once again, the staff was friendly, and a ""no judgement zone"" was preserved.

The gym has most of the standard fare: 100+ assorted cardio machines (treadmills, ellipticals, stationary bicycles, stationary recumbent bicycles, arc trainers), free weights, 30+ weight-lifting stations, along with massage chairs, tanning booths, and locker rooms.  Around 20 TVs are hung from the ceiling in front of the cardio equipment, and the audio (along with FM radio) is available from a receiver box on each cardio machine.

Planet Fitness also has spacious and clean locker rooms, although the lockers are first-come, first-served, and they don't actually lock.

The prices are also good: $10/month for a basic membership and $20/month for the premium, ""black"" membership.

Overall, I like the place, and I'm sure I'll like it even more once they change their schedule to 24x7 next month.",10,1,1,True,2,323,0.132510229838435

We both loved the charm of the place and the simplicity of it.  After placing our orders up front, i'll get to those in a second, you find a seat in the next room and wait to hear your name.  The only issue i see with this is if it gets really loud, as you may not hear the chefs/cooks call your name with a lot of ambient noise (would be nice if they maybe installed speaker or something for whenever necessary), but for being out to dinner on a Saturday night around 7:30, there was very little noise other than the ambient rumbling of idle chatter from everyone else waiting.  

Everyone at City Fresh is super friendly and the quick, casual feel is wonderful.  

And then the food, oh man the food.  So I had the Pasta Primo and my girlfriend got one on the daily specials, the Vegan Sun-Dried Tomato Pesto Ravioli (neither of us are vegan, it just sounded really good).  We were blown away!  Yes, ""Fresh"" is in the name, the simplicity and quality of our dishes was amazing.  The flavors were vibrant and wowed us.  We were instantly hooked.

Equal parts shop and coffeeshop, I dare say it's the most beautiful space in the city.  Thanks to the creative vision of co-owner Thommy Conroy, the space is a quirky botanical paradise.  Due to lack of free public wifi -- and space -- it manages to avoid the ""coworking space"" feel of many other coffeeshops in the city.  That said, if you're looking for a place to work all day, this isn't your place. If you're looking for a beautiful space to do some reading or writing, 4121 is perfect.

Now, on to the coffee. I believe the coffee drinks here are the best in the city. Especially their cappucinos and lattes. They use beans from Heart roasters (one of my favorites in the country) and the local Klvn (also very good). They use Snowville Creamery milk. Enough said -- you can taste the difference. Their matcha latte is excellent as well. Also, the drink prices are more reasonable than they are at nearly any other coffeeshop of comparable quality in the city.

They also frequently offer chocolate truffles handmade by Lindsay, one of the baristas who works there. Her truffles are DELICIOUS. I often stop here just looking to see if there are truffles available. There are a variety of tasty craft/bean-to-bar chocolate bars for sale as well. Be sure to check the prices of these with the barista if you are budget conscious in any way -- these are not your average chocolate bars and range from $9-20, in my experience.

They also let me bring my dog in if I'm getting a drink to go. She enjoys the ever-changing plants and curiosities of the space as much as I do.

The place is beautiful when you walk in and very tiny. They sell coffee. loose leaf teas and small baked goods.

I am still wrestling with this cold so the lady suggested a tea for me to try. She recommended a mint and ginger tea to help clear my sinuses. She told me that if I have it there I get a glass pot to go with it. Cost whether you take out or enjoy it there is $3.00.

All they have are bar stools but they are a little wobbly so I would advise be careful. I looked over some of the artwork on the wall and learned that the other man who works here makes those pieces which are for sale. Outdoor seating is available but limited.

The tea was just what I needed to provide me with relief from my cold symptoms. It is located on a not too busy street so it is quite easy to miss.

I asked him about the list of truffles setting there and asked if they had certain ones. His response was, ""you're guess is as good as mine. I don't pay attention to which ones we have."" So I skipped the truffles. I order a latte and an expresso to go. While he was working on this I asked him about one of the plants which was adorable and he literally knew nothing about it and told me if I'm not good with plants not to bother. I actually am great with plants but I skipped purchasing the plant. He brings me the expresso first. He had it in one of their cups and I said, ""I'm sorry but I asked for the drinks in to go cups."" He had the audacity to respond with, ""well can't you just fucking drink it here."" My jaw dropped and he poured maybe 3/4 of it into a togo cup and gave it to me. If you are the owner of a store and you treat your customers like that you shouldn't own a business. It was so uncomfortable and so awkward I couldn't stand it. He then continued to say ""I just never work the counter. I can't handle it."" Ummm.... why do you own a coffee/floral shop.

The shop is so aesthetically pleasing that I honestly just want to hang out here all day.

All of that being said, this is primarily a coffeeshop, so the flavor of the coffee is important to consider in the rating.

The bakery items here are homemade and are quite original (check out 4121 Main's Instagram to see a few of the treats).

Hold on. Coffee shop? This is an art gallery. Art on the walls in the form of paintings and stuff. Beautiful green art growing in pots and vases. Art sitting on the shelf. Pottery art. Especially memorable was a V60 type cone dripper made out of pottery by Sarah Veak. A gorgeous piece of art on the bar that is called Spirit, by Kees Van Der Westen. Those are names that receive utmost respect in the espresso world. There was even a piece of art behind the bar. It was the operating the Spirit piece of art and producing lovely pieces of consumable art. Come to think of it, it did talk a little and answer my questions. I think that was actually just a regular human. He was calm and cool, just like art. Not real friendly but not unfriendly, just like art. Nick the Customer was really friendly but that has nothing to do with anything. And the barista managed to make me a tasty espresso using Guatemalan coffee from Heart roasters. 

4121 Main. That is simply the address. Maybe that is why it is flying under the coffee radar. I guess they could have called it Mocha Joe's Java House on Main or some sickening name like that. Then people would have known that they sold coffee. But in that case, they may as well name it Clueless Coffee or Coffee Amateurs. I wouldn't go to a place with a name like that.

The Franco Harris auditorium seats about 400-500 people and is reminiscent of Broadway theaters in NY except only much nicer.

Kelli won her Tony in 2015 for her portrayal of Anna in the revival of ""the King and I"". She has an outstanding voice and as I guessed it she does sing opera. She is slated to perform at the Met in Lincoln Center later this year.

Kelli sang a variety of songs from her various shows including my favorite ""South Pacific."" I loved how she did the ""man"" roles including Ezio Pinzo's ""This nearly was mine"" with such emotion you could actually want to cry over his loss of Nellie Forbush.

Kelli told the story of her life as she moved from the farms of Oklahoma to the bustling city of life of Manhattan. She ran into great notables along the way including the late Marvin Hamlisch whom she dedicated a song to. She also met the grandson of the late Richard Rodgers.

She does do some composing and one of the songs she had written was spot on! Perhaps the best part of the evening was when she donned a cowboy hat from SW Randall and sang about a country girl resettling in NY and going into labor at the Metropolitan Opera house. She had everyone in stitches!

She sang at  Sunday's (9-24-17) wedding of Phillipa Soo to Steven Pasquale. Phillipa was the original Eliza Hamilton in the famous musical Hamilton. She rapped in fun a little but it would have been nice to see a rendition of ""Burn"" from her. She sang a tender song at the show's end but was given a callback to sing ""I could have danced all night"" from My Fair Lady.

This concert held at the August Wilson Center enable me to see only a little of the ground floor but was a different venue for the series Trust Cabaret series. The show was excellent and was glad I had the opportunity to see her perform live in concert.",10,7,14,True,9,351,0.046337910295481385

My concern is that the nonprofit Center is apparently in debt and having trouble raising enough funds to keep it going. Given its namesake, it does seem appropriate that it should struggle.

I ended up calling Conicellas at around 7:00 and was told that my pizza would be ready in 20 minutes.  So I plugged the location in Google maps and off I went.  I am actually quite glad that I had the maps app too as Conicellas is a little further down Greenfield Avenue than I expected and right across from a church/school.  The outside of the place isn't much to look at and the inside consists of a small area to pick up your pizza and that's about it.  Whenever I arrived at 7:30, my XL cheese pizza was ready and I paid $12 cash and was out the door.

As with all pizzas, the pizza here can be broken down into its three major components: sauce, crust and cheese.  The sauce on Conicellas pizza didn't really have any spices in it that I could taste.  Don't confuse it with boring or bland though as the tomatoes brought a brightness to the pie and I enjoyed the slight acidity to them which helped to balance the cheese.  Speaking of the cheese, it had a nice flavor to it and there was an ton of it.  As a matter of a fact, the first piece that I tried to eat had half of it slide off because of its proportion to the thin crust.  Last but not least was the thin crust which I thought was fantastic.  It was super crispy and on the first two pieces that I ate I audibly crunched through each piece.  Then after it sat for a little while the center of the pie became less crunchy while the back was still nice and crisp.  It had a nice flavor too and I think I could taste a little yeastiness in the middle of the crust at the back of the pizza.

The bottom line for me is that I will head back to Conicellas again in the future.  As a matter of a fact I plan to take my wife in the near future as I am absolutely positive that sure will love this pizza, especially the crispy crust.",2,1,0,True,22,398,0.11046790603779746

http://www.wesa.fm/post/hot-meal-ride-doctor-south-side-woman-connects-city-s-displaced-services#stream/0

I'm going to start with this: the barista was great, the restaurant is clean, the prices are status quo and the coffee is, well, eh.  If I had been there on any other night, my review may have been entirely different.  But I wasn't.

I headed to Crazy Mocha to study for a religious studies course I'm taking while ingesting a gallon of coffee because that's what college students do these days.  Everything was fine, the barista was very kind, I was getting some work done without the nagging of my children.  Within a half an hour of being there, the restaurant got noticeably busier--maybe 10-15 more people within 45 minutes or so (I had been the only customer up until this point).  Still, noise level was fine, atmosphere was great, the place had actually become pretty cozy.  And then this happened:

A lady with a group of people came in and out of the restaurant a few times.  The last time she came in, she stopped to thank the lady in the corner, who came in about 50 minutes after me (lots of studying on my part).  The following conversation ensued, which I could not help but to overhear.

The lady in the corner of the restaurant is apparently someone who works as a district manager or perhaps within corporate for Crazy Mocha.  She was adamantly schooling the lady with the group about the group being there every night from 7:30-8:30pm.  She informed the lady with the group that because her group was there, other customers were leaving and they buy more expensive drinks than the group that was there.  She explained that the baristas only make minimum wage (um, hello Crazy Mocha--get with the times, minimum wage is NOT acceptable) and rely on tips from customers (because, you know, adding a dollar to my $5 drink makes everything better--thanks for making customers supplement your employee wages).  Apparently this group does not tip enough money.  She told the lady with the group that Crazy Mocha is a place of business and not for group meet ups, and reiterated her point by saying that she won't even let the Girl Scouts meet up there.  She basically informed this lady that even though each of the people in her group paid for a drink, snack, whatever, they were somehow not entitled to seating in the restaurant, and furthermore, she stated that she ""knew"" that this lady gave them all money so they could get a drink so they are still not paying customers.  Please note, the entire conversation (for the bit that I was still there for) was laden with the Crazy Mocha lady calling the lady with the group ""Honey"" and ""Dear"" in the most horrible, condescending way--it made my own stomach turn.

I'm sure this isn't everyone's experience of Crazy Mocha, and I am glad for that.  It is great to support a local company and I'm always happy to be doing so; however, I am so appalled and disgusted by the horrific conversation that occurred in Crazy Mocha today, that I will never step foot in another Crazy Mocha, nor will I ever suggest it.  To anyone. Ever.  To suggest that one customer is more important than another because of the cost of their purchase is elitism and repulsive.  Kudos to the lady with the group though--she was very kind and receptive to what the Crazy Mocha woman was spewing, and maintained herself way better than I ever would have been able to.

Please note: I tried to step in and explain to the Crazy Mocha woman that the people in the group each bought something and were causing no problems, because she said ""Well, I wasn't here the entire time"" and I was.  She informed me that it was between her and the lady with the group.  So although she was not there the entire time and could not speak of the paying customers, she was also not interested in my account even though I had been there the entire time.

A few weeks ago I was having coffee outside in the Starbucks patio with my mom after a spin class when 3 people sat on a bench in the front of the mall near the Starbucks patio and began smoking. The disgusting smell and carcinogens that we were inhaling made us physically ill so we left and I wrote an email to Gina. She didn't respond but I was hopeful that she would have someone policing the smoking and enforcing the rules given my email...I should have known better.

The next week we went back and there were 3 of us total and guess what? Same thing but this time the chef for Houlihan's was also out front smoking... Nice right? 

This is so offensive to me, set my health aside...how about all of the kids, babies and pregnant women who had to and have to walk through the smoke cloud to walk into the front door of the mall?  What about all of the mothers that try to sit on the patio of Starbucks but are forced to leave for the health of their children? 

Until this issue is fixed or Gina is fired and they get a real manager in there that knows what they're doing I will be boycotting this sad little mall.  There's really no good stores anyway besides Williams Sonoma and Restoration Hardware so I'll just shop online or go to Ross Park if I need something.

The mix of shops has an obvious upscale vibe and it continues with the way the mall is spacious and has ample seating areas.  Even the bathrooms were much nicer than they are at the typical mall and were extremely clean.

Overall, the store selection caters more towards women.  Perhaps that is why there are so many seating areas available.  They need to keep the bored husbands happy.  There is even an eyebrow threading place (which seems out of place because there are a few small chairs in a giant retail space).

Here's the full story: On August 18th 2014 I met my friend George for breakfast at Panera Bread, my favorite restaurant in Mt. Lebanon. We sat together for a little more than an hour engaged in deep conversation. He then asked me to take some head shots of him for publicity purposes so I suggested we walk out into the lobby area of the Galleria to do that. The conversation had been so pleasant and the weekend so lovely that I plumb forgot about how shopping malls have ""no photography"" policies. Nor of course was there any such notification posted between Panera and the mall. My sole purpose was to show George's face and to keep the background as blurred as possible. That's what defines a ""head shot.""

I took a few shots with potted plants as a backdrop and then a few more in the central area with posts and beams in the background. Altogether I took nine pictures of George and then we walked to the main exit of the mall on the top floor near Panera to get in his car. Suddenly a man in a Polo shirt ran up to us and vehemently began questioning me about what I had been ""up to"" and loudly asserting that photography was forbidden in the Galleria. I tried to explain that I had simply taken a few close-ups of George and that I had no interest in depicting the mall and, in fact, had not done so. But the security guy was on a tear. He would not listen to anything I had to say and kept insisting that I had committed a very serious infraction and that he would have to ""detain"" me, though he never made clear what the point of detaining me might possibly be. By his outraged tone of voice, domineering body language, and accusatory words any passer-by would have assumed that I had broken Anthropologie's window, sprayed paint on Houlihan's marquee, or at the very least had just shoplifted a chocolate bar from the Godiva store.

The mall cop continued despite apologies and explanations. He threatened to call the police. (And what would they have done with such a flakey complaint?) Though I was under no obligation to do so, I even showed him the pictures I had taken of George to assure him that no crucial mall information had been compromised. Much to my chagrin he then said, ""There's ninety more pictures on that card and I want to see 'em all."" He could not be mollified by any recourse to reason. Finally his supervisor showed up and when the situation was explained she allowed as how we could proceed on our way with no further hassle. 

This experience of rudeness, bureaucratic intolerance, and downright absurdity left a bad taste in my mouth. It would have been so easy for the guard to have said something like, ""Sir, photography is not allowed at the Galleria mall."" To which my response would have been, ""Oh I'm so sorry. I didn't realize that."" At this point the exchange would have ended amicably and with mutual respect. That's what I would call a reasonable way of enforcing a policy. As it is, I believe Galleria has overstepped it's bounds and made the experience of doing business there about as pleasant as shopping in North Korea. 

I wrote an email about this experience and emailed it to the person listed as mall manager, Gine Mercorelli. It was returned as ""undeliverable."" I also contacted three executives of Jones Lang LaSalle Americas, Inc. (the operators of the mall). All three had valid email addresses. None of them responded to me. 

My advice: find a more pleasant mall where you will not be treated as a criminal for snapping a selfie with your cell phone.",3,4,0,False,17,710,0.07093321398140276

Been to Bravo once, Houlihans, the Asian restaurant upstairs once too.  I've never watched a movie there but the main attraction for this place was Anthropologie.  My wife loves that store and for the longest time it was the only one in all of Pittsburgh until we recently discovered there is one near Point Breeze at Bakery Square.

Besides Anthropologie from what I can remember there's always been a Godiva and Restoration Hardware as well.  This mall is small and there's no department store.  I dont' really know what type of mall to call it because it's not like there are super high end stores here but there some good stores like Williams-Sonoma.  

It's hard to explain the true purpose of this mall because it's not like it is really complimented by surrounding strip malls or big box complexes kind of like how Robinson has the Summit etc.  Either way it has Anthropologie and that is why my wife always wants to come here when we are in PGH.",2,0,1,True,15,275,0.1357814231954356

How much more expensive? Enough that the Galleria is typically window shopping only for me...

On the plus side, the Galleria is a bit more upscale and beautiful than the South Hills Village by design, so at least while I'm window shopping I'm able to enjoy a lovely building and atmosphere! Although I really don't like driving in its parking lot; I often have to park in the underground segment of the lot and doing so kind of creeps out the claustrophobic in me.

And in fairness there ARE some things in here I can afford and do enjoy going to. The Hibachi place here is pretty good, and it's hard to go wrong with a Panera or Starbucks stop. Other highlights for me include the delicious chocolate shop, happy hour at Houlihans, and (to break my food and drink theme) the Coldwater Creek store. I also love just sitting around the fountain they have in here...it brings back memories from when I was little and ran along the ledge of that very fountain. (Surprise surprise, I fell in once or twice...little me wasn't a well-behaved child sometimes.)

Still, the good things here aren't enough to make me love the Galleria more than the South Hills Village mall space. There's no bookstore in the Galleria area, its movie theater is overpriced (especially considering the run-down state of the theater itself as of my last visit), and honestly I've had a bad experience with sales reps in a number of the stores here; many have been overly pushy in an obvious effort to boost their commission payments, to the point that they've tried to sell me items that don't even fit me properly.

If you're going to visit the Galleria, I say do it for the food. There are definitely some decent eateries here (I only mentioned a couple of them).

Since they have only general coffee and espresso drinks, I ordered something I would usually not go for--a blended iced coffee drink from the ""Chip Chopped Iced Coffees"" list: chocolate peanut butter.  I have no idea what they put in this (though I saw the barista pull out an instruction binder and rip open a plastic baggie of mystery powder) but it had balanced tastes of coffee, chocolate, and peanut butter.

The negatives: There is usually open space but unfortunately there are these loud obnoxious gamers who play board games all over the coffee shop in groups.

I hadn't been to a Crazy Mocha in years, and this was one of the few coffeeshops in SqHill I hadn't been to. For those of you who may not be familiar with Crazy Mocha, it is a regional coffee shop chain found in PGH and the surrounding environs.

I ordered the Pittsburgh hot chocolate, which is listed under the smoothie section because it's not a hot chocolate at all!  Rather, as the barista explained, it's a chocolate smoothie topped with whipped cream.  Given that I was looking for something refreshing, this was perfect.  It was pretty sweet, but not overly so, which was nice.  However, unlike another dessert-y drink I tried at a coffeeshop in the South Side, it wasn't particularly creative or special--I was hoping for some cinnamon or something.  Anyway, if you stop in and are looking for a cold and dessert-y drink, it's worth a try.

This Crazy Mocha, like others I've visited, lends itself more to socialization than getting work done.  The space is larger than it looks from outside, consisting of two rooms, and is rather cavernous--thus, sound has a tendency to echo.  Nevertheless, it wasn't too busy on a Sun. morning, and there were a few people with laptops or newspapers, in addition to a larger group with a baby.

While this Crazy Mocha isn't my go-to coffeeshop in SqHill (my favorites are Commonplace and Dobra Te), it offers a nice change of pace, not to mention an alternative to Sbux.  While it's a chain, unlike Sbux, it's at least locally owned, so if you patronize it, your money stays in the local area.  So, show some PGH love and stop in here, rather than at Sbux across the street, to get your caffeine fix on! 3.5 stars.",11,6,10,True,20,308,0.08735731365748298

The undersigned hereby demands that you: Refund my money for the defective door and improper installation.

I bought a brand new storm door and it was installed months ago. The first door had scratches and damages; photos were sent to Donna and she ordered a new one. A month later, the new one was installed; the screen is defective and the door does not hang properly. I have been waiting another month for replacement. I have emailed her constantly, and get answers such as I must wait ""until July 30"". I will not. I will not wait since I have been waiting for months, (the ""Action"").


Please note that if I have to commence legal proceedings in order to require your performance of the Action, this letter will be tendered in court as evidence of your failure to attempt to resolve this matter. Further, you may be liable for any court costs, attorney fees and damages, including punitive damages.


You might want to contact a lawyer to discuss your legal rights and responsibilities.

I was scheduled for a week later, it was a Friday 2:30 to 6:30. They called the night before to confirm and give us the 2:30 window. I removed and disposed of my old appliances the night before. 

I waited all day and no one called or showed up. I called the delivery company after 7pm they said no one was coming because they ran out of time. I requested a follow up delivery to be dedicated for a specific time since it was their mistake. I didn't want to burn another day of work. They said no. 

I went back to the store to try to find a reasonable solution. They were polite and seemed sympathetic but told me they couldn't help. They also told me I was not able to pick the appliances up myself.",1,0,0,False,18,147,0.07200178855895764

I had forgotten why I stopped going here when I lived in the area.  Once inside it came back to me why I do not enjoy this location.

First and foremost I had the configuration of the lot that this sits on.  It gives you this feeling that the store is huge on the inside.  Maybe it's the perspective that you see when you are driving from the mall to here, not sure what it is, but it's a bit misleading.  Then there is the wreck that they call the parking lot.  It is like nobody knows how to navigate this one.  Plus add in the summer plant parking lot section and it's utter chaos.  

Then there is the inside.  Expecting it to be a huge store, it is not.  Compared to other big box hardware retailers, even other stores from this chain, this one is rather small and oddly organized, not in the good sense.  As I mentioned, I was looking for two items in particular which should have made for an easy stop.  NOPE.  I searched and searched for the insulation strips for my AC forever.  Thinking that it might be in the seasonal section just because in Pennsylvania we don't use AC year round.  Welp after looking up and down every seasonal aisle multiple times and going outside, I couldn't find it.  I figured it had to be elsewhere but who knows where.

I moved onto the masking tape, I figured as I was looking for that I could ask any available associate along the was for the other item.  Fat chance at that, I did not see anyone available.  I headed in the direction of where adhesives would be thinking that tape might be there, nope again.  Having bought paint at another location I remembered there was the blue painting tape in that section and just maybe other tapes might be there, YUP.  I figured one thing out on my own.  However I still hadn't found an associate.

I find myself wandering the store looking for any available associate.  When you do see one it usually at the other end of the store and you basically have to full sprint to get them.  When I did get to talk to one, I was only told aisle 12.  I don't work here, so to me aisle 12 might as well be a deserted island.  There are many items in aisle 12, those many items reside on many shelves at different heights, those many heightened shelves have many sections.  It took me a long time to find the insulation strips, but I did finally find them with very little help from an associate.",7,4,4,False,17,460,0.0643952225059747

We have had good experiences and not so great ones.  This past Thanksgiving weekend we saw that they had a good sale for appliances.  We were in need of new appliances so we went to check it out.  

 We had a good idea of what we wanted and the promotions that they had going on for the holiday week.  We got there and started looking over the appliances.  We were looking for a new refrigerator, dishwasher, oven, and microwave above the stove.  We needed some help because we didn't understand all of the different savings we could have and we had questions about the appliances.  A lady working there was helping out a customer and when she finished up we asked her about the sales.  Her name was Leslie.  My wife was asking her questions and she said it was best if we came to their wall that had their specials for the week so she could explain it better.  She told us to take our time and to let her know if we had any questions.  

 We looked it over and understood it better after talking to her and looking at the different specials.  If we bought 4 appliances for above $498 and about $230 for the microwave we could save another $200 on top of their sale prices.  It was really good.  Once Leslie realized that we were serious  about buying all of these appliances today she really took care of us.  The fridge model and dishwasher were there for us to look at but the microwave and the oven wasn't there on the floor.  So she brought it up on their website for us to look at.

     To make a long day and story short we got all 4 of the appliances.  Leslie did a good job of going over the order, delivery, and warranty options for our big purchase.  When my wife told her that we won't be going with any of their extended warranties and that they are a rip off she didn't bother us about warranties anymore LoL.  
 She gave us the card of their kitchen installer there for us to contact later in the year when we are looking to renovate our kitchen at home.

     Overall it was a good experience here at home Depot. Leslie was really good at helping us and we made out on a great deal.",13,7,13,True,12,423,0.06657001046856886

Lowe's is closer to me and frankly has a bigger selection but I was looking online for an outdoor rattan storage box.  I found one through the Home Depot for a fair price.  I could have had it shipped directly to me for like an additional $15.00 which would be counteractive to my frugality, I decided to pick up at my local store for free.  I ordered the storage container and completely forgot to mark which store I intended to pick it up at.  Seems as though the default was Savannah GA.  What's that noise Homer Simpson makes?  Doh!

So I called the 800#, as I couldn't figure out how to change this.  She was great canceled my order, and replaced it to ship to Pittsburgh.  Great so far.  Even better it came a lot quicker than predicted.  Awesome.  I set out to pick it up.  Thus begins the decline.  I go in the service desk is right up front.  I need to check on a hose crank thingy, pretty sure that's the technical term, so I went to look at those in the lawn and garden area and decided to purchase that as well.  Track back to the service desk, and stand in line.  Soon I am speaking to the lady.  Giving her my info for my online order.  She finds me does some stuff on the computer and says someone has to bring it up front.  Ok, I said then I will run my hose crank out to my car and move my car to the front of the building, assuming by the time I would return it would be waiting for me and it maybe big so easier to load.  I go and do just that.  At least 10 minutes had passed since I was told someone would bring my order up.  I return to the desk and continue my wait.  Nothing.  No one is coming.  There are employees all around but no one is bringing my order up.  I am getting beyond impatient.  My wait now since coming back in was 15 minutes.  Add the 10 from before and we are pushing almost 30 minutes!  WTF tell me where it is, I will get the thing!  I am eyeballing everyone and looking at my watch.  One employee finally says, ""You still waiting for your order?""  No I just really like hanging out at service desks looking irritated.  I said, ""yes and I have been waiting over 15 minutes, since I went out to pull my car around. ""  He asks the lady who Lord knows what she says and heads back.  About another 5 minutes passes, but I can see in the home depot horizon the man carrying what appears to be my order!  He approaches and shows me the box to confirm.  My only expression was ""well hallelujah"".   He asked if I wanted to open it, I said no not really I think I spent enough time here.  Well I still needed to sign it out!  Back in line to speak with the lady who originally called someone to bring up my order, yea right, and wait again.  Finally up front she says the system is slow and it's processing.  No I think everything here is slow.  So she jumps to the next person in line and starts ringing them up while I wait again.  Finally the paper prints, I sign and book it out of there with much frustration.

First off, this place needs an update like yesterday! But that's besides the point.

I wasn't aware of any other entrances, but after we got in, I believe I saw another entrance on the 2nd floor or something, which would've been nice to know or maybe directed to so the main entrance wasn't overflowing into Oakland! But, maybe that's just my lack of knowledge haha. Also, it would be convenient for those who may not be able to do stairs too well.

Although it was a little crazy, the staff was available every couple of feet willing to direct you where to go. I've never been to the Petersen before so this was super helpful!

When you pay for a concert arent you paying for your seat? If I explained to her she was just as rude as everyone of the staff there. I said is everyone in PA this rude? She said yup. I was livid. I called back she said she was a supervisor so id have to speak to her boss. So i did - i went on for 20 mins about how this was the WORST & unsafe experience ive ever had. If there was a fire or earthquake people would have easily been trampled over bc front row was completely congested. After all that he basically said i had never been in front row before so i wasn't familiar with how it works. You have got to be kidding me. I have never in my life been to a concert where any & everybody can walk right up to front row. Might as well let everyone back stage while youre at it too. It was absolutely absurd! I had to go out of my way to write this review because it was that bad. No one offered any help no one offered to move my seat nothing. None of the staff could even point me in the direction of the head boss. I felt like i was in a twilight zone. This was the WORST venue i have ever been to. & from the few parts i could see the show was actually good & we could have had a good time if security was maintained like it should be at any concert or arena. One more thing i wanted to add was the boss & supervisor i spoke to over the phone kept saying that id have to speak to the tour manager because they decide how many security guards are at the concert. The problem was not how many security guards there was. The problem is that the security guards were doing absolutely nothing. There was two on either side of front row and three in the middle. And youre telling me 7 men over 300 pounds cant control a bunch of women trampling over eachother? Smh. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME OR HARD EARNED MONEY GOING HERE. ALMOST 1,000 DOWN THE DRAIN.

There are quite a few different food choices like bacon cheese fries, ice cream, pizza, popcorn, pretzels and much, much more. The day I went they were even giving out free t shirts on the Concourse level. I must say that the bathrooms are extremely clean also.

Formerly the site of Pitt Stadium, ""The Pete,"" as it is nicknamed, opened in 2002, its construction mostly funded through a 10 million dollar sum donated by philanthropists John and Gertrude Petersen for the primary purpose of hosting college basketball games.

Spectacular mirrored and futuristic enough to behold from the outside, the grand lobby is virtually a museum of trophies and sports memorabilia, which brings me to my point: Leave this place to the hardwood contests, a pastime I can take or leave. 

I attended a Judas Priest gig here recently, and while I had myself a fantastic evening of sound, sight, and fury, it felt as if I was in an oversized high school gymnasium. The planks that covered the floor gave the arena a makeshift feel, and Britain's elder gods of metal deserved so much more. 

The sound was fine I suppose, but hell...Priest, man, Priest! Yeah, Consol may have been too big (roughly 14,000 end stage) considering Perhaps a two-night summertime open-air stand at Stage AE (5,500 outside, 2,200 inside) would have been more apropos?

WAIT!  I also appreciate some of Lovato's music so um, yea.  I was curious to hear her sing live (no shame) and was pleased with the outcome.  Of course, with all shows, there were high and low points.

Demi Lovato is an early 20 something who got her start along with Miley and the Jonas Brothers via Disney (like many others).  Lovato has actually managed to surpass the child star curse in a unique way that some from her generation should take note.  She candidly talked with the audience about overcoming addiction and spending time in Africa.  So young and wise, Lovato sometimes came off strong (in my opinion) to an audience of primarily tween girls with her wise words of wisdom and empowerment.  I do, again, appreciate her delivery of some tough love in which she stressed that people need to care about themselves and not the thoughts of others.  She ended one of her speeches with, ""I really don't care,"" punning her current hit with fellow young diva, Cher Lloyd.

Now for the missteps in the show. Honestly, there are only 2 comments here.  Some of the high energy pop-rock songs (presumably album cuts) drowned out her vocals, leaving my ears to only hear Lovato basically scream over the clash of guitars and synthesizers (not to mention the loud cheers of the audience).  One other misstep was a cover of ""Thriller"" by Michael Jackson.  No typo, Lovato escaped the stage for her one and only costume change and came back to a karaoke version of Jackson's massive hit.  It was karaoke at best, to which she gave a try at joining her back-up dancers with some forced choreography.  Taking from her previous speech, I know she was having fun and just ""really did NOT care.""

Ending on a positive note, Lovato showed us that she can play the piano and guitar in stripped down versions and melodies of fan-chosen songs.  I was so very impressed by the 1 hour, 30 minute set that saw Lovato push out vocals from her tiny frame with NO backing track.  Refreshing in today's age of pop-tart fast food music.  An honorable mention must go to Christina Perri for her vocal talent.  She warmed the crowd up with a catalog I did not realize she had with such charisma and simplicity.

Yes, I'm a two-time Pitt alum, Pitt employee, and I bleed blue and gold, so of course I'm going to LOVE the Pete.  Let me tell you why you should, too!

I'm at the Pete in most cases for Pitt basketball games.  Many people say the Pete is one of the best (if not THE best), venue for college basketball in the country.  I'm sure if you talk to a Duke fan, they'll debate this with you, though ;)  Why is it the best?

-Not a bad seat in the house.  @Curtis G and I have had season tickets for two years in the last row, behind the net, and I've never felt like I couldn't see the game or wasn't fully immersed in the experience.
-The BEST student section EVER, the Oakland Zoo.  I'm sorry I graduated after the implementation of this group of crazy, die-hard Pitt basketball fans.  Their enthusiasm is contagious!
-The men's bball team is consistently a contender, even if some years aren't as good as others.
-Women's bball games are FREE.

The Pete isn't just for basketball; various concerts and other events are held here, like Pitt's commencement.  I've only ever been here for games, though.

Pro-Pete Game-day tips:
-Park on lower campus (metered street parking is free after 6) and take the free shuttles available in front of Soldiers & Sailors up to the Pete.
-You can purchase food in the food court on the 2nd level and take it to your seats if you are looking for something more than your standard concessions.  The actual Pete concessions stands take credit-cards, the stand-alone vendors are cash-only.
-Any discounts you have at the Panther Team Store cannot be used on game days.

1.  Bruster's offers doggy dishes for our furry friends.  Small scoop of vanilla ice cream with a dog bone.  Free with purchase.
2.  They have a frequent visitor card that is free.
3.  If you take anything to go they will separate the ice cream and the toppings such as hot fudge.

There were plenty of signs pointing out that no child under 12 should be unaccompanied by an adult. Yet no employee seemed to enforce this rule. Everything I had was pretty enjoyable. I got those to-die-for home made rolls they make, and some of their amazing fried chicken, mac and cheese, broccoli, mashed potatoes, salad.. I had way too much food.

It was all very fresh, only a few items that needed refilled because they were empty, and the desserts are always superb! The thing that honestly bothered me was the fact that there was no local ATM. These days, not many adults carry around cash, they just swipe and go about their business. I am one of these people. I never have cash handy. Most restaurants give the option to tip with your card, Golden Corral is not one of those places. After paying and eating, I realized I had no cash for a tip for our waiter. I went up to the hostess station and politely asked the hostess is there was an ATM readily available. She said no. So I looked up on my phone if there was an ATM nearby.. and there wasn't. Super super disappointing. I always tip no matter what, cause the economy sucks these days, and not tipping is just rude to me. I had to leave my boyfriend while I drove a few miles away to the closest ATM so I could tip our waiter, who was really nice by the way. Next time I'll have to remember to bring cash, but I didn't like that there was no easy way to tip. Something to keep in mind here. Overall my experience wasn't too bad.

In these situations, look no further than Golden Corral. It has been years since I've last been to a Golden Corral, but I do recall a huge selection of food at the buffet. To my enjoyment that element of the restaurant remains the same, and we all left feeling like we ate our money's worth and then some!

It was tough to give 3 stars because I feel like this place deserves 3.5, but I'm not sure if it's quite a 4.  The buffet had so much food, and my only worry is the freshness when there is so much to choose from. All of what I ate looked fresh, and same goes for what I saw on everyone else's plates. It would've been nice to see some more healthy options, but I did enjoy what was at the salad bar. There were mashed potatoes, baked potatoes, sliced fried potatoes, red potatoes with cheese, a sweet potato casserole, and literally any form of potatoes you could think of. If the same creativity was put into some more healthy sides I would give GC 4 stars without a doubt. 

As far as main dishes go, there were so many different meats to choose from that it would've been nothing shy of a carnivore's dream. Pulled pork, bourbon chicken, smoked turkey, ribs, fried chicken, BBQ chicken, fish, you name it, it was at the buffet. I'm not a red meat eater, so it was great to see this many options for proteins.

GC's staff was super friendly, but at times it was like our table was being double-teamed by the wait staff. We had 4 adults, 1 little one, and 1 newborn at the table but you would've thought it was a table of 10 the way we were waited on.

We met about 16 family members for dinner at Golden Coral around 3:30.  Of course the place was packed and a line was out the door.  We were pleasantly surprised at how quickly we were seated.  We had 2 tables of 8.  The staff were all helpful and engaging and up for the holiday challenge.  The servers in our group worked together to make sure we had enough drinks, cleaned our used plates and were very attentive.
The food was constantly replenished on the buffet and came out hot and fresh.  This was one of the best Golden Corral's I've visited.  Keep up the good work.  Thanks for making our family Easter Dinner a great experience.

My father drags here there often cause he LOVES eating at the Golden Corral.  He likes it because of the variety and reasonable price. My father even tough he loves eating here does get annoyed while going thru the line because this place hustles drinks.  My father gets a drink after he sits down.  It is annoying for the patron to have to balance drinks to a random table. They give a Senior Citizen discount.  To get the Senior Discount mom and dad just tell the Golden Corral workers that they are seniors.  


He likes the broccoli and fried okra.  Yesterday he told mom not to get it on her plate because it was cold.  Mom the EXTREMELLY picky eater gets strawberries, salad with Blue Cheese dressing, and fish but it's much too salty.  Yesterday the waitress asked mom and dad how they were enjoying there meal.  Mom said it's good, but it's the fish is too salty,  and the waitress said: "" I'm glad your enjoying your meal.""??? HELLO

Mom says many times when they sit down the table is sticky and they have to wait for someone to wipe it off.  

On a different visit mom and dad were standing in line for the cook to take steak off the grill.  American cheese was near the steak that was being grilled.  It was there for the cook to add it to the steak as he grills if a patron wants it.  Also standing in line was a little boy and his mother.  The child reached for a piece of cheese while the cook was in the back, and the cheese was never intended for the patrons to reach and take and all the slices of cheese fell onto the floor and the child put all the dropped American cheese back up onto the tray.  When the cook returned my father told the cook to trash the cheese because the little boy had dropped all of it on the floor.  The cook threw all the cheese into the trash.  The little boy's mother also standing in line just laughed?  No wonder when these students get to school they are not ready to receive an education?

Yesterday mom tried dessert at the Golden Corral. Earlier mom says 3 little girls were at the chocolate fountain.  One of the little girls was twirling her rice crispy treat under the chocolate fountain and she kept twirling it, and twirling it until no more chocolate would stick.  Then she pulled the over chocolate covered rice crispy treat out licked it and stuck it back into the chocolate fountain. Later when mom went over to the rice crispy chocolate fountain and had to wait for 2 little boys to finish playing in the chocolate fountain for her to be close enough to reach the yellow cake.  She then she could get close enough  to reach for the cake that had been scored.  A patron also in line with her son noticed mom was having a hard time reaching for her cake.   The cake sits too far back for mom's petit arms to reach, so she told her son who was also waiting in line for cake and not one of the unattended children who were playing in the chocolate fountain to help mom reach the cake.  The nice little well attended boy obeyed his mother and helped mom with her cake.  Mom said when she got back to her table with her cake it tasted cheap although it was a beautifully decorated very colorful and round like a birthday cake.  Mom didn't even eat it because she didn't want to waste the calories.  My dad got the red velvet cake.  He usually gets a plate of chocolate chip cookies.  He does eat them all.  

Mom says If she has to be dragged in here she prefers to go in the morning because it's not as crowded or noisy.  My dad too mom here when she was out if rehab and mom appreciates his taking her here even though mom had lost all if her appetite at that time.

When I got up to the buffet and started at the salad bar I was horrified to see they had run out of plates! The one server let slip that the dishwasher had broken down. Lovely!  We had to use take out boxes to eat out of. There were people pushing and shoving to grab one of the few remaining clean forks. I had been smart enough to grab a handful for my table.

The food itself was just ok. The fresh brewed tea was the best part.  The mashed potatoes, though not exceptionally good, were made there (or so the sign read). Everything else just looked like food a toddler had just been playing with on their ""special cartoon plate"". The chocolate fountain is really neat. It would work better with fresher tasting goodies to dip into it though. The cherry macaroons I tried were sadly stale. The last thing I tried was the chocolate cake. It took 5 minutes to get one slice unstuck from the rest of the cake and all I could taste was icing.

They got all the goodies. Fried things. A salad bar. Various prepped salads (macaroni, tuna, potato, etc). There's several soups. A nacho station. A dessert station. Their claim to fame is this big grille in the middle where you can get all you can eat steak. I think its sirloin tip. Its fairly tough but its unlimited. Its also hard to get it cooked right unless you like it raw or burnt. There's a variety of sides from baked potatoes to mac and cheese to collard greens and brussel sprouts. There's pizza and bread and fried chicken and pot roast and ham. Depending on the day of the week and the season, they have different items.

I dunno..we just weren't terribly impressed this time. I mean, we didn't have like unreasonably high expectations from a Golden Corral but neither of us really enjoyed it that much this time. Ironically enough, I was able to get my steak medium rare this time.

A few weeks back, we had lunch there and I ordered the California club sandwich. The only special request I made is I asked to have the mayo on the side. I only like a little bit and they always put too much on.  Service is normally slow there, but I was prepared for this so no big deal. Unfortunately, when they brought my sandwich it had big sloppy globs of mayo on it. 

Tried to get the waitress' attention but she didn't come back for a few minutes. Then by the time she brought the manager over and he offered to make me a new sandwich, we had to leave or be late to our next activity for the day. I scraped off what I could and ate some of the sandwich, but there was so much on there that it didn't do much good.

Tonight my son really wanted Chili's, so off we go. The restaurant was pretty busy so I was surprised when we were seated right away.  We sit about 10 minutes, two waitresses walk by and tell us they will be right with us. 15 minutes later we finally have drinks. (Like I said, service is almost always slow here so I was not upset by this at the time)

We all placed our orders at the same time. I ordered the 6 oz sirloin with grilled avocado, medium. 15 minutes later my husband and son's food comes out. ""Wow, we are getting served really fast!"" I just assumed that she didn't have enough hands for mine and would be right back


10 minutes later I still don't have my food, and the servers are nowhere to be found. Finally our server walks past or table and my husband grabs her, pointing out that I still have not gotten my order. She apologizes and goes back to check on it. 

20 more minutes go by and now we are short on time because we have a birthday party to go to. The server finally brings out my food. The steak was not only rare, but it was cold in the middle. 

So now my plan for a nice family dinner is ruined, my husband and son are finished with their meals and watching me eat mine, except I can't eat a rare steak. I can't send it back because we are out of time. 

Now I work in customer service, so I was calm and polite throughout the whole process. What REALLY finally got to me is that our original server refused to come back to our table. She sent her coworker over to check on us and walked by our table like nothing happened.

The only positive thing is that is did speak to the manager and she was very apologetic. I told her that I was trying to be patient because I knew they were busy, but she said they were properly staffed for the crowd and it shouldn't have happened.

Hmph. 

Anyway, I was in the mood for steak but didn't want to pay a ridiculous amount, so a friend and I decided on Chili's. Maybe the service is lacking on weekends, but it was great on this Wednesday evening. We actually had 3 different servers checking on us, and hardly had to wait at all for anything.

We started with the soft pretzels. I didn't care for the queso but my friend really liked it. I had the sirloin with loaded mashed potatoes and broccoli. The broccoli was a little to salty/seasoned, but I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Friend had the Cajun Pasta, which was delicious, but came out a little cold.

I also had some kind of tropical martini, I think. I can't remember the name, but it was tasty and on the strong side (mmm).

We split the Skillet Chocolate Chip Cookie. Amazing.

Each table has a ziosk, where you can look at the menu, pay with a card, figure out the tip, and play games (there is a fee for the games!). I hope this doesn't eliminate restaurant jobs, but I really liked it...

Friend would probably give a lower rating because his pasta was a little cold. But I'm the one writing the review, so I say 5 stars. Overall it was a good experience.",0,0,0,False,18,246,0.09938547121777146

The entire night our waitress was simply rude with a poor attitude. Turns out she was a ""trainer"" for another waitress, and here I was thinking she was the trainee. 

Ordering a simple salad was a chore because finding out what dressing was vegan was a tall hop, skip and a jump through their staff and ziosk atop the table. They weren't understanding that I couldn't have honey and continued to suggest items containing it.

My boyfriend and I were super hungry, and we wanted to spend a little time out enjoying the evening. We had a $25 GC for Chili's and thought this to be a good time to use it. (Hey, being broke really sucks!) We walked in and were cheerfully greeted by the hostess. Once we were seated, we waited quite awhile for the server to come and take our drink order. By the time he arrived, we already knew what we wanted. 

He seemed rushed and impatient. That made me feel anxious and embarrassed, and I don't like that feeling when I am going to eat....or basically ever. We went with the appetizer and two entrees for $20. We chose the onion strings and jalapenos. You can't go wrong with fried onions, right? Wrong. Super wrong. They were really salty and peppery, and it was hard to finish them. In fact, we didn't even get a chance. The waiter took the leftovers without even asking if we were finished! 

A long long wait went between our appetizer and our entree. We ended up ordering the 5-cheese pizzas. They eventually arrived, and they looked good. They were lukewarm though, and we were missing ranch that we had asked for multiple times. 

So we waited an eternity to get ranch. This pizza desperately needed the ranch to make it palatable. Seriously. It was that bad. 

The server kept taking ages to come back and pay attention to our needs. I ordered a Blue Moon, and it took super long for that to come to the table too. I needed a drink after going through what we went through for this meal! Oh, but he didn't even ask to see my I.D. Some people might think that's cool, but I am extremely bothered when I.D. checking is not strongly enforced. I could have easily been an underage girl, in fact, a lot of people think I am! I thought this was extremely irresponsible and dangerous behavior, and it's not something I would expect from ANY establishment! 

Other complaints include the fact that what is vegetarian and not vegetarian on their menu is rather ambiguous. Did you know that their seasoned tomatoes are seasoned with some kind of animal-protein based seasoning? What is that about? Gross. 

I really dislike leaving bad reviews, but our experience here was just so awful. I felt bad for the server because he seemed like he was having a hard time, but everything kept getting worse, and it is extremely unacceptable.

Here's the things that made me happy about their services; 
A salesman approached us before we even entered the building to help us and see what we were looking for. He was a very nice man, and didn't try to scam my boyfriends mother into buying anything too out of her price range. He wrote down everything she was looking for and saw what they had in the lot. She found something with everything she liked and ended up going with a brand new 2018 Jeep Grand Cherokee Loredo. 
It's has been over a week since she's had the vehicle, and is now experiencing electrical issues with it. She made a call to the dealership after the problem first started to see what could be done, a person on the phone said the general manager would give her a call within the next 20-30 minutes, seeing as nobody else knew what to do. Nobody called. So she called back and scheduled a meeting with there general manager at another time, and he never showed up. So after countless attempts of trying to see how the situation could be rectified, she didn't even want the car anymore. She didn't want to drive it because to her it seemed unsafe, and wanted to give it back. Before she attempted to do this, they took the vehicle to run diagnostic tests to see what the problem was. They found nothing to be wrong with it. They also stated that they cannot just take the vehicle back due to what the contract stated. The contract clearly stated otherwise and says that if there is something wrong with it to where it seems unsafe, it can be returned. 
They offered to switch the vehicle for another one. Another thing she didn't want to do since this brand new car she took home a little over a week prior, became unsafe. My boyfriends brother who helped his mother with the whole thing because he knew more about cars than she did, was so upset that he posted on Facebook about how this dealership can not be trusted, to try and let his friends and family know to not get a car from this dealership. Within about 12 hours of this Facebook post being posted, the Jim Shorkey general manager gets on the post and made comments about the situation and basically stated the exact opposite of what I just stated. Saying contract didn't say the vehicle could be returned, yet no excuses for why he didn't show up to the meeting, or even at all. To me, this was very unprofessional. If anything the general manager should have got on this Facebook post and stated to call customer service, instead of being abrupt and disrespectful. 
To me this whole thing is very upsetting. My mother in law had a car prior to this for over ten years and we all wanted to get her in something brand new and really nice, because she deserved it. A lot of personal things in the family come about not to long ago and she was just exhausted from running constantly and she whole heartedly deserved a nice car. Her being upset makes the whole family just as upset, something you'd think the Shorkey dealership would understand seeing as they're a family owned business. I hope the Jim Shorkey team sees this review and understands that my mother in law has been going through an extremely rough time recently, and her vehicle gets her everywhere, since she's constantly going from place to place. To her this is just another thing to throw onto the pile of things going wrong in her life recently. You really let us down Jim Shorkey, I can assure you nobody in our family will be going to your dealership for any vehicles from this point on. 

Shoutout to the salesman that helped us that day however, such a nice guy! Didn't pressure her into anything and she liked how he listened to what she wanted before even showing her a car. I thank you sir.",2,0,0,False,15,718,0.10150963695686215

I think his hand where tied because all he could say was when are you looking to buy and when can you come in. Finally, he went to get the sales manager Tim Zawondiak. Tim started the off with the typical salesman BS. Come on in, take it for a ride, we're the largest car Jeep dealership with the lowest prices, no one can beat our prices. I asked him if I could buy the Jeep for the Internet price. Again, he refused to answer the question. After pushing the issue multiple times, he tells me that the internet pricing has all of the deals and incentives applied. Nothing that I didn't already know, I buy a new car ever 2-3years and this isn't my 1st rodeo. I said to him I know that, can you review deals and incentives with me and we can see what I qualify for. He said that he can't, that I would have to come in test drive the Jeep and then he could tell me the price breakdown. This went back and forth a few time and he said that they weren't going to sell it to me and hung up. What an idiot. If you know that I am shopping by price over the internet and phone, and that you are going to lose me because your internet price is just to bait people in, then at least take a stab at it. I wasn't even trying to talk them down in price. I just wanted the true price. I will be buying a New Jeep regardless.

They do not have their own store, but various stores around town sell their water ice, and their stand can be found at many local events.  I've always bought from them directly through their stand, which I've found at Bryant St. Fest, Downtown PGH Pop Up Market, and Bloomfield Little Italy Days.

At their stand, La Scola typically offers a few different flavors of water ice, as well as frozen lemonades.  Their water ice is the best in PGH, without a doubt.  It has a silky texture, and the flavor is refreshing and delicious--though it's pretty sweet, so be forewarned.  Their frozen basil lemonade was less impressive, unfortunately.  Rather than having a slushy texture throughout like a frozen margarita, it's just basil-infused lemonade with some ice blended in that floats on top, making it awkward to drink.

While La Scola's water ice is the best in PGH, I am held back from awarding a perfect rating for a couple of reasons.  First, I'm from DE, which is in close proximity to Philly, the water ice capitol of the USA, so I have exacting standards.  While La Scola's water ice is definitely a cut above Rita's, it doesn't approximate the quality of family owned stands in Philly such as Pop's.  Second, the prices are on the steep side.  In Philly, a small sized water ice around the same size as La Scola's runs $1.75 at Pop's, and has pieces of lemon in it to boot.  On the other hand, it's less expensive than Rita's--but then again, what water ice isn't?  Third, the ""frozen"" basil lemonade needs work (see above).

Despite these criticisms, La Scola's water ice is definitely worth a try, so I suggest picking some up if you happen to see their wares around town.  I don't remember all of the stores that carry their water ice, but I do remember that Groceria Italiana is one of them.  If you frequent the local festivals like I do, you shouldn't have any trouble locating their stand!",11,8,9,True,1,349,1

Sometimes it is frustrating when food truck after food truck doesn't have even a single vegetarian options. Blue Sparrow has you covered with multiple options (and delicious ones at that). Only disappointing thing as far as that goes is the only dessert they had when we got there was a peanut butter bacon brownie (which a friend said was delicious).

I ordered the tofu Bahn Mi. You just don't see vegetarian Bahn Mi options enough. There was no debate for me as to what I was going to order. It was a little messy but well worth it. The sandwich was super flavorful between the tofu and sauce and veggies. Honestly I wanted another but the truck had left. Boo!

My boyfriend ordered the falafel burrito. The falafel was moist and flavorful and the burrito was good, but definitely did not stand out as much as the Bahn Mi. We also felt a little spice or hot sauce would have been a great addition.

There are the staples, but we already have quite a few trucks doing bbq, tacos, hoagies, and burgers. So for me, a food truck that makes things found nowhere else, whether truck or B&M, and makes them good is an automatic win. Blue Sparrow's focus is ""street food,"" but with their current menu items I could probably get away with specifying most of them as Asian / Latin fusion street food.

The two staples are the pulled pork banh mi an the ramen burger. Both are fantastic, and I probably prefer the banh mi myself. It contains many of the traditional ingredients found in a standard Vietnamese sandwich, like the pickled carrots, cilantro, cucumbers, etc., and the bread is nicely toasted. Instead of the traditional Vietnamese ham or pate, the meat consists of a large portion of tender, delicious pulled pork, enough to fill you up. The ramen burger, already quite popular on the coasts, is a different beast . A bit smaller than the banh mi, it contains a bed of pickled cabbage and leafy greens on top of a very very tender and juicy patty, all of which is held together by two fried ramen ""buns."" The combination wasn't my favorite thing in the world, but definitely do try it for the novelty, if not for the beef patty.

They also do a grilled kim-cheese, essentially a grilled cheese sandwich (they gave us a quesadilla after running out of bread!) with kimchi inside. I enjoyed their various tacos more though, and I was able to try the tikka potato masala and bulgogi tacos. The curry in the former was deliciously creamy with all the levels of spice you'd expect when getting the regular Indian dish, while the latter combined tender marinated meats with kimchi, all wrapped in a tortilla in standard Ko-Mex style.

Overall, the problem was with the process.  I liked my salesperson.  Everyone was friendly enough and I have at least some hopes for the service department; however, for a luxury car dealership, the process lacked luxury for sure.  

I went on a whim on a Saturday and test drove one vehicle.  That went fine and was reasonably efficient.  I then wanted to see a more upgraded model before deciding.  That took over an hour, since as a city dealership, they have to go get the car.  The car ran out of gas on the way, so there was that delay as well.  I looked and left, asking the salesperson to provide pricing via e-mail because I was out of time by the time they got the car there.   

There were some wires crossed in the communication, but we eventually all got on the same page and I made an appointment at 9am the following Saturday to show them my trade and complete a cash purchase.  I had already shown my tendency toward impatience on the previous visit.  And I very clearly stated that I didn't want to be there all morning when I made the appointment, so I was hoping that they'd have everything ready except for my trade value.  Not so much.  

The trade evaluation was quick, but then the inefficiency really started.  They didn't have the pricing ready, so there was a wait there.  Then the finance guy was needed (no loan, but he also does title work and the warranty sales spiel ).  He had not a thing prepared either, so I had to wait for him.  Then to the cashier, who had to call and verify my check and issue a receipt - more waiting.  The tech guy who explained all the buttons was next - had to wait for him too.  His spiel needed a little work, but it was good enough.  Then the car needed gassed - again, another wait. 

All told, an efficient process could have easily taken under an hour.  This took over two and a half and that was with me quite impatiently skipping pieces and trying to push it along.  The problem is that their whole process is linear - you are passed from one person to the next with a lot of waiting in between.  Why they can't gas up the car while I am doing the paperwork is beyond me.  Why the tech guy couldn't have done his thing in the 45 minutes I spent waiting for the finance guy is also beyond me.  Why the cashier couldn't have worked on my check while I was doing title work...you get the idea.   

I am sure that people generally spend a ton more time buying a car and perhaps that is normal, but I made an appointment specifically to avoid all of that.  If they are truly serving the luxury market, they need to coordinate the buying process better.",7,1,0,True,21,522,0.09539804857059687

I called three different times on a Saturday afternoon to inquire about a vehicle I saw online. Each time, the operator put me on an endless loop searching for a salesman that never answered. I decided I was close enough, so I just drove down. When I arrived, it seemed like nobody was working. I couldn't find a sales person and there was no receptionist to point me in the right direction. 

I ended up finding someone at a make-shift desk in the back, dressed like he didn't work there. He grabbed the car and parked it in the garage near the service area. He told me it ""just came in"" and hadn't been detailed yet, although it was flawless in the pictures online. He didn't show me any features of the vehicle or ask me if I had any questions. He handed me the keys and asked if I was familiar with the area. I said no. He didn't seem to care. He told me which way to go out of the garage and asked me to let him know when I got back. Didn't take my name or license at any point. Could not have cared less. 

It was hard to see the condition of the car in the garage, so I pulled over in a lot down the street to see it in the sunlight. The car was in TERRIBLE condition, nothing like the online ad, which claimed the car was ""certified pre-owned."" The exterior had dents and scratches on every single body panel. The passenger side body panels were rippled front to back as if accident damage had been repaired improperly. Inside, the car was disgustingly filthy. It looked like someone dumped a bag of brown sugar on the rear seat. I opened the glove box and the door fell on the floor. There were stains and scratches everywhere. The parking brake had snapped off and been super glued back on. Headliner, seats, floor... filthy.

I ended up giving the guy my contact information and he said he'd call me when the car was detailed (what a joke). That was about two months ago and I never heard back. Imagine that. 

I was ready to buy with a check in my pocket and left knowing I'd never return. I ended up buying the exact same model at another BMW dealer in the area a few weeks later and had an excellent experience, as I would expect.

Even at max a/c, which is very loud, (forget listening to the XM radio you are paying for) the cabin of the car is not comfortable. When someone else uses the car they say- ""I couldn't figure out how to get the air conditioning to work?"" I have taken the car back to the dealer many times and they advise the a/c is performing to specifications. Recently, P&W had the car for nearly a MONTH. Whole weeks went by and they did not contact me. Then, the service technician  told me the car just ""doesn't like me."" So their offer to fix this situation is that they will give me $33,000. for the car that I paid $54,000. for less than 2 years ago. What a deal. Mike Brown, the General Manager is  condescending, arrogant, and completely useless. He strung me along for weeks claiming he was talking to corporate to see what they would do for me. Their game is to have various service reps call and no one ever accepts responsibility or corrects the problem. I certainly did not expect to pay for a luxury car and then be treated so poorly when it came time for P&W BMW to stand behind their product. Being without my car for a month has been extremely inconvenient. Now to learn that BMW is doing ZERO to resolve the issue is inexcusable.

He was helpful and said he would have someone over right away. Within 5 minutes a salesman was there and went over the product I was looking at. He answered my questions and gave me his recommendations. He even took the time to look over the ""open box"" item we had found online but couldn't find it in the store.

We were then given to the manager of appliances to complete our purchase. He too checked on  the open box one and told us that for one reason or another they couldn't find it. He advised that if color was not an issue with me then I could save $100.00 by opting for white. I decided on that option knowing i would be getting a new model. He allowed me to select a delivery date and even arranged for me to be added to my husband's credit card.

For extra protection they offer what they call Geek Squad services. I have been pleased with the Geek Squad before since I protect my pc with it so I purchased a protection plan. He did tell me if I encounter any problems with my delivery then give them a call and they would give me an immediate replacement.

They had a special financing option due to the July 4th holiday so I decided to go with that one. I'm looking forward to using a new HE washer.",2,0,2,True,8,289,0.10202249977274903

My husband and I went in together and went our separate ways (he went to the surround sound, I went to the cameras).  Apparently he had a similar experience, but I can only account for what I personally went through.  I knew exactly what I was looking for because I've been doing a lot of research online, and was ready to try it out in person.. really get some good info and see how it felt in my hands, how it worked, etc.  After basically loitering around the DSLR camera's for about 15 minutes waiting for some help (everyone around me was helping other people or just literally ignoring my attempts at contact) and going totally un-noticed, I decided to just figure it out on my own.  When I picked up the camera and attempted to use it, an alarm started going off so I put it back down and waiting for someone to come.  An employee did in fact come, but his only mission was to turn that alarm off!  When I tried to engage in some kind of conversation he literally just turned around and walked away.  Ooooookay, so that's the game we're going to play.  So I picked the camera back up and, yep, you guessed it, set the alarm off again, and patiently waited for someone to come back.  It just so happened that it was the same guy from last time, and although looking especially irritated at my tactics, I smiled at him and told him I was glad he came back because I would like some help.  His idea of ""helping"" me was standing there with his hands on his hips just watching me struggle, saying nothing.  So I finally asked him if he could help me out and give me some info and answer some questions, and his response was simply ""that's not how you do it!"" - in response to what I was doing concerning the camera.  Let me paint a picture for you- I'm standing there, holding an almost $1,000 camera, with the intent to purchase.  I dont know about you, but I can think of a couple better ways to handle that situation as an employee.

American whiskey has its roots in this town but the Prohibition ended it all, and it just never happened again because of PA laws until it got changed!

Wigle is one of the new pioneers in town. Of course, now we have many craft distilleries from all over the country -- actually from all over the world, but I still think Wigle is worth a visit.

This location is attached to the William Penn hotel, a historic, cozy location. The tasting room is rather small, with bar tables on one side for tasting, and a small shop on the other side. They offer many kinds of flights, featuring their whiskies, gins, or other spirits. They also sell cocktails, and it's a perfect place for a pre- or post- dinner drink.

Wigle makes *so many* kinds of whiskies, it's overwhelming. I would suggest going for a tasting flight to find the bottle you like, and then cap it up with a cocktail that features that spirit. That is how I found their barrel-aged gin, which I actually like more than their whiskies (especially in a good cocktail!).

I took my mother here for her 80th birthday, and we were both very disappointed with the restaurant. If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE! For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera. The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served. Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée. No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold. Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals! He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera. It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing! My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery. All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed! Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals. We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake! It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant. We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections. They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake. Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint. Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant?

Our server was Devin, and she was fantastic. Two warm rolls of bread with butter and we ordered the rice ball appetizer, two balls in marinara sauce.

I ordered the salmon in asparagus cream sauce with green beans and pasta marinara. The risotto was excellent along with the pasta, perfectly warm/hot. The filet was cooked perfectly (medium rare) but did not have much flavor, and really liked the salmon. The food came at a good pace. For dessert we shared the brownie with homemade raspberry ice cream.

If you are planning to try this place, MY RECOMMENDATION IS TO GO ELSEWHERE!  For our entrees, my mother ordered the chicken risotto, and I ordered the pasta primavera.  The entrees arrived way to soon, about 5 minutes after our salads were served.  Every fine dining restaurant knows to allow enough time between the salad and entrée.  No one wants to eat their salad, while their entrée is getting cold.  Then, the chef, who only had one other customer besides us, screwed up both meals!  He made my mother's chicken risotto without chicken (when it doesn't even come that way), and he added chicken to my (vegetarian) pasta primavera.  It was obvious that the chef was very inexperienced and had no idea what he was doing!  My pasta primavera was swimming in olive oil, and my mother's risotto was extremely watery.  All SEASONED chefs understand that risotto should be cooked until all the liquid is absorbed!  Also, everyone knows, that when you screw up two meals at a fine dining restaurant, you offer the guests either free dessert, a free appetizer, or you comp their meals.  We were offered no compensation what-so-ever for the chefs mistake!  It was clear to me that the employees at Slate Bistro have no idea how to properly handle problems at their restaurant.  We were also very disappointed with the dessert selections.  They did not have any of the traditional fine dining desserts you would expect such as tiramisu, crème brulee, and cheesecake.  Instead they served all ice cream desserts that you would find at a pizza or burger joint.  Who wants grilled banana bread and a scoop of ice cream for dessert at a fine dining restaurant?

When we got there, the place was pretty empty, but it filled out as the evening wore on. The old place was a pizza joint and the owners of Slate kept the layout pretty much the same (although I noticed an upstairs area which I do not recall from Pepperoni's days?). One can immediately see why they moved as the new kitchen is substantially larger than the old one. Adding in a patio for the warm months surely cannot hurt and the new digs are much more open, bright, and more modern looking. The one negative to all of this is that the noise level goes up the more people show up. In our case, when we left, no tables were left open and it was difficult to have a conversation.

The menu seems to have changed a bit as well. It's no longer a monthly menu, but, rather, seasonal. On the other hand, it's larger than it used to be and they have a wide variety of offerings so people of all kinds of culinary persuasions will find something to try. They did keep the specials, which was nice (although, for whatever reason, our party did not partake of any of the specials when we went). They also eliminated the bar and the place is now BYOB. Another difference is that some of the entrees come in a ""Lite Bite"" version which is roughly half of the other portion. In my case, I tried exactly that and was very satisfied with the quantity of food received. Another bonus to that was that I was not overstuffed and therefore had a chance to try one of their desserts!  :-)

We started out with an appetizer of the fried risotto. The two perfectly cooked risotto cakes were easily split into four portions and with the pesto cream sauce on them were a really tasty and delicious appetizer. Our table then ordered the Scallops and Shrimp; Mahi Mahi; and Chicken Milanese. Each of the entrees was perfectly cooked and seasoned and we all enjoyed our dishes. There were only three possible sides for each of the entrees: A veggie side - which was french green beans with carrots and a little bit of summer squash; a herbed rice; and penne in a marinara sauce. These were all find, but nothing outstanding. To finish off, we had the Turtle Torte which was exceedingly rich and decadent. Even with all four of us tackling it, more than half of it ended up in a takeout box to come home with us. 

Reflecting on the desserts, I missed the more creative offerings that they used to have, but I am not sure why these were more pedestrian? Perhaps the chef's mood? Who knows. Anyway, for a price of about $35 (including tip) per person, we had a really good meal in a place we've liked for years and will return to readily.",0,0,0,False,31,518,0.09770364650407841

First impression: the place is small. Like really small. I overheard the waiter telling the cook that they had 2 tables of 6 with reservations tonight and the cook was worried that they might not have enough food. Small.

You walk in to the bar area. The floor seems slanted, chairs are crooked, and (sitting in the corner of the bar where we were) smells faintly of cat pee. The building was obviously once a house, so whatever, it seemed dated (really dated), but clean.

We ordered drinks at the bar and they took a surprisingly long time considering that we were the only people there. 


Dining room: Really really dated. The chairs reminded me of something from a college dorm rec area in the 70's or 80's. Nothing was necessarily what I would call ""Nice"".

Menu: Ok, so here is the confusing part. You are in this ""Bistro"" with dated furniture, and broken bar stools, but then the dinners average $25. When I think bistro, I think sandwiches and salads, fresh light food etc. Nope, none of that here. 

Food: we ordered one of each appetizer. calamari was ok, fried gouda was a chunk of cheese slightly warm with 2.5 small crackers, the other app had meat in it, so I don't know about that one. Salads were expensive and ridiculously small, like the asparagus salad had 3-4 sprigs of asparagus. For dinner I had shrimp and scallops.... Not great. It was, what seemed like 2 scallops sliced 3 times each to look like 6 scallops, and 3 pieces of shrimp halved to seem like 6 pieces of shrimp. It was in an overpowering cheese sauce reminiscent of boxed mac and cheese with a little white wine added to it.

Service: Really bad! Our waitress was an older woman and she was just plain rude! At one point one of the other women at the table asked why the bread was hard when the last plate of bread wasn't and she completely snapped at her. WTF? Seriously?

With Valentine's Day being much too hectic to venture out unnecessarily, I had made a reservation for the following evening after being turned away by a number of establishments that had been completely booked. It then occurred to me that Slate had been in existence for over a year and that I had yet to enter its doors. Snagging a reservation for the day after Valentine's Day, we eagerly awaited our window of fine dining for weeks on end.  

Chefs Dave Sgro and Cheryl Tacka opened Slate in August of 2012 in what was  formerly a modest home on a surprisingly modest street just beyond South Hills Village.

When we made the left onto Donati Road, we saw pickup trucks in driveways and plastic toys strewn in yards, half-obscured in dunes of snow. I thought I had mistakenly set the GPS to my former neighborhood of Brookline or my current one of Beechview. I felt comfortable and welcome before I even scraped a boot on Slate's doormat. 

Inside, we were greeted by soft jazz music and erudite conversations concerning 'the blues"" by some patrons at the bar. Without hesitation, Kay and I were whisked into a back room that was populated only by us by the time our salads were ready for service, providing us with a wonderful intimacy I haven't had at an area restaurant in some time. 

""Wow, ya got the whole place to yerselves, now,"" Our all-around fabulous and down-to-earth server told us once the last couple settled up and left as we finished our appetizer. ""How 'bout that, huh?"" She would ask with a wink. Her name was Trish, and giving us a memorable and effervescent experience was her wish. She pretended to be a loving aunt for the following hour or so, hopping about excitedly like a rabbit whenever we needed anything as if she was eagerly chaperoning a first date that she herself had arranged. 

As the name implies, Slate is all about erasing staleness, changing their relatively small menu each and every month while adding unique twists on the classics of American cuisine. However, after investigating their bill of fare online, I wasn't sure what to order! Alas, there were specials, and they ended up making up the bulk of my supper. 

A trio of Coconut Shrimp unassumingly began our odyssey. Plump as miniature turkeys, each prawn was coated in an ideally crispy and sweet coconut breading, the hot oil drawing out any and all natural sugars. A pool of sweet/sour sauce kept the shrimp afloat, adding more honeyed flavor to an appetizer that was close to an Asiatic dessert. 

A revised take on The Slate Salad (apparently what comprises their house salad changes from time to time if the other photos and reviews are an indicator) was next to grace our table and palates.  A cornucopia of mixed greens were dressed in a marvelously milky, herb-laden vinaigrette along with roasted peppers, slivered almonds, and a blessed blizzard of Asiago. It would pleasingly and successfully clear our tongues for the grandeur to come. 

My fears of stingy portions being haplessly compensated for merely by frou-frou plating were chased away by the twin titans that were the Grilled Pork Chops. Also from the specials addendum, each weighty slab of hog was topped with roasted bread crumbs and a hefty glob of creme fraiche-like goat cheese and left to wallow in a pond of savagely savory and unrepentantly reduced au jus. To respectfully contradict another reviewer, my chops, cooked medium, had just enough fat around the edges to impart flavor to the rest of each piece of meat's inch-thick plus body. Far from arid, vital liquids gushed with every cut and bite after dragging the morsels through the brackish waters below.

An almost tropical marinara topped one of two sides in the amazingly al dente rigatoni. The other, a steamy, luxurious bed of creamy garlic rice, approached a fine demonstration of risotto, making for a celebration of the simple elegance of humble grains. 

Unsure of whether or not to finish with the Eclair or the Brownie Heart, I followed the spirit of the holiday and chose the latter. Deep and dark, the brownie, literally shaped like that symbol of devotion, had uncanny chew once its thin, flaky hide was broken and a smoky taste that invoked cast iron pans and campfires. Like everything else we gormandized that chilly Saturday evening, the vanilla bean ice cream and whipped cream were scratch-made in-house to absolute faultlessness. Kay had herself the golden, bakery-quality Eclair (we were assured that EVERYTHING on the menu was prepared on the premises sans store-bought shortcuts, and I'm inclined to believe it...) which was topped with a maniacal, hellish fudge ganache and filled with a heaven-sent, vanilla-riddled custard. 

Slate is more than a mere ""bistro"" -- it is a house of togetherness and romance that just so happens to serve up consummately prepared food. Take someone meaningful to you to cozy Bethel Park someday and experience Slate's ever-changing delights by flickering candlelight.",16,6,9,False,12,842,0.08940225841762141

We went here for a date night. I love trying new off-the-beaten-path restaurants, which are so rare in the South Hills, so we were excited to try Slate Bistro.

The prices were expensive, which I am more than happy to pay for if the food is good.
 
That being said, I'm pretty sure I spent $24 on a Lean Cuisine entree.

The chicken was processed, thin, and tasteless and was swimming in a mixture of rice and generic sweet and sour sauce. My date got a $30 pork chop which was mostly fat. I didn't even know pork chops could be that fatty. Even the inner-most part was all fat. You get the idea. As well, his food was served with some type of home fries that were clearly frozen at one point, possibly made by Ore-Ida. As well, my date got a Fat Head's beer that they charged $7 for. At Fat Head's, the same beer is $4.

I really wanted to like this place, but it was just so comically bad, we couldn't do anything but laugh about it.

Made a reservation on a Friday evening and arrived to a warm welcome from the bartender/hostess.

Quaint former house, with all kinds of different seating to accommodate those who want some privacy, and those who want to have their fingers on the pulse.

We were seated in back (as per my request), it was date night so I wanted to have a lovely evening with my wife....very cozy.  Service was prompt and non-intrusive.  Our pre-dinner cocktails were delicious and on point.

We ordered the chopped tomato salad that felt like someone's mother prepared it (loved it, thank you Chef Dave!!!) and the other item I believe was prosciutto or pancetta wrapped mozzarella...gorgeous, I can still taste the pesto! Sopped up the love with some of their soft bread!

We had a main course of fontina ravioli and another of sautéed veal.  The ravioli, was nicely done with a creamy sauce and cheese for days....delicious!  The veal was cooked flawlessly (could've eaten it with a spoon) and had a nice brown sauce that was clearly reduced for hours....it had a depth that I'm sure had to take a long time to develop.  Loved the veal!!!!

Dessert was a gorgeous warm chocolate brownie with a made in-house mint chocolate chip ice cream, I can still taste the gentle balance between the mint and chocolate, it was perfect! Dessert felt like getting a hug from mom....all was made with care and love!!!

We had a bottle of wine from their list, and I must say that the list was modest, but priced well, and covered a wide range that fit their menu.

This is a former house, which isn't an issue, but the decor does not match the caliber of food. Strange postcard-like Van Gogh prints and other dollar-store type pictures.

The good. The food is fantastic. I have been here twice and love that the menu rotates monthly. The food is fresh, much more creative than most of the typical South Hills restaurants, and tasty. I have tried various steak, lamb, and seafood dishes (my dining companions love to share) and I have been impressed with all. Don't be fooled if the portion isn't massive, I have never walked away hungry and doggie bags shouldn't be part of a high quality dining experience. Save room for dessert anyway, all homemade.

When I pulled up, I was surprised to see that I had been here before. Apparently, Slate used to be another upscale restaurant I believe it was called Cafe Giorgio which was ""famous"" for their chicken whitford (?)  . Well, there are new owners now and, much to the disappointment of my dinning companions, they weren't willing to give the whitford a shot. However, the menu did have some interesting and equally alluring selections. I chose to go with the pork mignon.The menu stated that the pork was topped with flat iron apple and apricot/orange rosemary glaze. I didn't really taste much of the apple and feel that it might have been better served in a chutney form. Also to note, in addition to the no substitutions rule, they have a very limited selection for sides. A starch du jour and a veggie du jour. You can get 1 starch and 1 veggie or two of either. I chose one of each which happened to be Yukon gold mashed pots and a carrot, broc, cauli mix. The sides were really basic for me. Nothing special about them. This is what I would expect from a run of the mill diner, not a nice 20-30$ a plate restaurant. Maybe that is part of the reason why the dining room was only about 25% full on a Friday night. For dessert, I decided to try the warm chocolate brownie with homemade strawberry ice cream. Again, I was left disappointed. The ice cream had huge chunks of frozen, inedible strawberries and the brownie was so light and fluffy that the ice cream chunks over powered any chocolatey taste. I was left craving a thick gooey, hearty brownie. What they served was not fit to share the brownie name. 
In addition, the service was odd to say the least. Our waitress didn't seem to know the answer to our basic questions and had a difficult time separating the checks by couple. It seemed like maybe it was her first day. All in all, I don't think I will be going back to Slate Bistro barring some significant changes.

The inside is what you would expect from a house as I assume this used to be one.  We sat upstairs where they had some odd dolls as decorations.

My girlfriend and I decided to start off our meal with the chicken skewers.  There were four skewers and it came with a peppered polenta and lime sour creme.  The chicken on the skewers was moist and pretty good and I really enjoyed dipping the polenta into the acidity of the sour creme.  For my entree I decided to go with the maccheroni [sic] & Cheese.  According to the menu it came with shrimp, scallions, pancetta and lots of cheese of which the lots of cheese got some comments at our table.  Whenever it originally came I was not very impressed as it did not have much color and seemed fairly small.  However the appearance was deceiving here as it was really good and extremely filling.

My husband called for reservations, and, when the woman on the line found out it would be our first time in, said she'd give us the super special table. She did, and we sat on the windowed in front porch of this charming restaurant, tucked into a cozy corner. I really like restaurants that are in older houses, and this place is cute. They claim locavore status here, and grow some of the herbs used in their food.  It also shows in the thoughtful and creative menu, which changes with the seasons and features meat sourced locally. I had the house salad and the Scottish salmon. The salad, a mix of green with fava beans, comes with a choice of 2 dressings...I went with the creamy garlic, and it was delicious. The dried favas still had their outer hull on, and, while you can eat this rather tough shell, I prefer to remove it, which was simple enough to do. I wish they took this extra step in the kitchen. Overall, a good salad. The salmon was done to the requested medium rare, served with a sweet and tangy balsamic reduction and diced, sautéed vegetables. This dish was very good. I would have given it a ""great"", but the veggies were a bit underdone and had been hit with lemon juice or some other acid before service, and it threw the dish off a bit...just too much acid on the plate. These are small complaints, and I'll most definitely be back to try more. Service was friendly and efficient.

We rolled in, 5 deep and since the place only seats 4 or so, we let the 14 month old loose to examine the valuables at her eye level. 

It's true like the other reviewers say, they indeed know their shit but since I don't know shit, I would be rather easy to fool but the two mothers I was rolling with, know shit and they seemed to agree and be willing to believe in the tea ladies shit.

The tea was good and since I'm more of a coffee fella, I think that speaks volumes. Our 6 year old went decaf and loved his berry tea and our 3 year old got hers cold and downed that shit.

My only beef with this place was that I was expecting little tea cups made of porcelain and a little tea pot that would sit in the center of a table of many that seated all of us, including the wandering 14 month old.

To be frank, I was also crossing my fingers that there would be British folk around that would tell me the things the tea lady did but in British.

Oh well, they all can't be winners.

Tea is sold by the ounce and depending upon how many cups you drink you can get a lot from a little. She suggested that if I wished to purchase then I should start at 4 oz.

It is shiny and just looks great!! She was unable to blow dry my hair since she was in between appointments so an intern blow dried my hair and she did a great job. I would most definitely come here again if I am in the area. Too bad they are 5 hours away from where I live. Thanks for a great job!,6,1,0,False,20,156,0.12641538462042104

Well, long story short: my hair looked the same. After she did hi-lights she put toner that was too dark and brought my hair to the original color. Also, the service I got that day wasn't exceptional, three different people did my hair because my stylist was too busy with other customers. I addressed the issue right away, I told them that I wasn't  happy with the color, it was way too dark, you could not see any hi-lights. They didn't try to do anything about it, didn't even say sorry or anything. When I called the owner in two days to tell him that I wasn't happy with my color, he told me that he knows that stylists work and  I am no longer welcomed to their salon, and his exact words were: ""Have a nice life""

The Vibe: 
It really has more of a ""spa"" feel than other places I've been to - it's very beautiful inside, has relaxing music, lovely scents, snacks, tea, coffee, peppermint oil neck massages, etc. When I go there I feel calm and pampered, so though it's a little pricey, I feel like I'm getting spa treatment on top of hair treatment.

The Service:
Everyone there is very polite and friendly, which is great for a place that has such an upscale feel (i.e. it's not snobby at all). Erin is my stylist and I LOVE her - she is an artist with color. My hair is very long and has been every natural color under the sun (blonde, brown, black, reddish, etc.), and it has never looked better than when Erin has done it. She has given me exactly what I've asked for every time, and she really knows her stuff: she is really smart and has a great eye for color - this is a huge advantage when someone is putting chemicals on your hair. She's friendly and fun, too!

The Price:
It's definitely pricier, but you get what you pay for. I'm always extremely happy when I leave this salon - it's worth every penny to know that my hair will look gorgeous and feel healthy when I leave!

The Look:
I'm not sure if they do this on purpose, but everyone who works at / goes to this salon has a classier, more ""natural"" look. In other words, this isn't the type of place where you would typically go to get a blue mohawk. I mean, I'm sure they would give you a blue mohawk if you asked for one, but that doesn't seem to be the modus operandi of this place. I like a more natural-glam look, so I find it comforting that the stylists in this salon seem to favor this look as well.

After experimenting with stylists and salons  from Great Cuts, Super Cuts and the non-significant ones, I was hooked on to a more ""fancy"" salon in Boston. Since then my standards have risen and once I reached Pittsburgh, I found Capretti & Co to be close to home and with a couple of good reviews on Google. 

Here I am filing the void on Yelp. This is definitely a fancy salon - they offer massages, manicures and pedicures in addition to hair treatments and cuts and a lot of their clientele are women. However, do not let this hold you back as they do cater to guys and some stylists are better than the others for men's haircuts. You can call and ask about the stylists and they will let you know who they recommend. 

My first stylist was Jill, who was great and patiently listened to what I wanted and checked in with me multiple times to make sure I was happy with the progress. 

The second time around, I decided to try Renee who I felt was more experienced (and I believe she is the owner). She also was attentive to what I wanted done with my hair and made sure she delivered.

Notable things about my experience at Capretti & Co have been the preciseness with which they cut your hair (to make sure both sides are equal length - i.e. attention to detail) and the focus they give to the client. Both times, I never felt that my stylist was rushing through the cut or that they were distracted.

The haircuts range from a 25-35 for guys depending on the stylist and include a shampoo along with the cut (and a head massage to begin with). They do use products that are gentle on the hair (as I was told).

For now, I have found a place that I can got o get my hair cut safely without worrying about repercussions later on, except on my wallet. I recommend Capretti & Co without a doubt.",19,0,2,True,3,361,0.23745612413484984

I chanced upon Capretti & Co while on a shopping spree at Settlers Ridge. After months of research,I selected Renee as the stylist I would trust with my tress. 

Fingers crossed and praying that I would not leave with a bad hair job I entered the salon. I was immediately greeted by the receptionists who quickly relieved me of my coat and offered a beverage and mixed nuts.

The pampering continued once I met my stylist Renee who, started off my session with a wonderful head massage and then went on to wow me with her coloring, sniping and styling skills. If I had to describe Renee in a word, I would call her a PERFECTIONIST. Her attention to detail and the care and single minded focus with which she tackled my hair blew me away. I loved the fact that for the entire 3 hours that I got my hair colored and cut she concentrated only on ME. There were no other clients scheduled or ""squeezed-in"" while I was waiting for my color to set...something that I commonly experienced while in Boston. What I personally am most excited about...the color and the cut was EXACTLY what I wanted and in sync with the pre-cut/color discussion which again was a pleasant surprise. 

Another positive is, being an Aveda salon, the products used were gentle on the hair and without any harsh chemicals. I also loved the ambiance of the salon on the whole. All the stylists share a wonderful rapport with each other and their clients making the atmosphere on the whole a happy and comfortable one. My mom who had accompanied me, got a pedicure while waiting and could only rave about Sara's (her pedicurist)  leg massaging skills.

It has been many years since I last stopped at Gus and Yiayia's and it was nice to see that everything is still exactly the same.  It even appears that Gus is still working although he is no longer shaving the ice himself.  If you have never been to Gus and Yiayias, it's a mobile food stand near the tennis courts of the Allegheny Commons park and they have been in that same location for as long as I have been alive.  The stand serves both popcorn and ice-balls but their ice-balls are what they are known for.  You see they have a big block of ice on the cart and a hand shaving tool and shave it for you whenever you order and then top it with one or a combination of their many flavors.  This last time I decided to go with a lemon-lime mixture while my fiance went with the cherry.  The ice was nice and refreshing especially against the evening heat and I enjoyed the taste of my syrups as you got a lot of the flavors but they weren't too sweet.  My fiances' cherry ice ball was quite different though as it was a bit over the top sweet for me. Who can begrudge an ice ball for being too sweet though as I am that's exactly the way that most of the kids prefer it..

The bottom line for me is that I would definitely come here again in the future.  Personally its like a walk down memory lane for me and I really enjoyed it.  The ice balls are good and they are reasonable priced so why not stop by an enjoy one?",2,0,2,True,4,295,0.1786070665582241

Alas! There was Paisano's! The middling first review almost deterred us, but in trying Paisano's, we found that a ""tough skin"" was not required. In actuality, Paisano's is a bit of a softie, from the lady that answered the phone to take down my order to the pie itself. 

Doughy and malleable, the cushy crust was the clear high point to our sausage-only pizza (Kay surprisingly detoured from the Kay Kombo this evening). ""Greasy"" this pizza was not. The cheese itself was dairy divinity incarnate, and the sausage approached the correct balance of crispness and succulence. I would have liked to have been able to detect more of the pasty sauce, however. 

Conversely, the dozen garlic wings we also ordered were brittle, fatty, and thus almost foolproof.

The delivery time took less that 20 minutes. Top. That. 

No one heckled us, either. 

Us paisanos eat pretty well, don't we? 

I just learned that ""paisano"" is Italian for ""peasant.""

There is no finer restaurant in the region!  Although it is conveniently located to many neighborhoods, a couple of minutes form the Greentree Exit of the Parkway West, It is tucked away in a business park.  It is not the easiest place to find on the first visit, but you will be glad you made the effort.

The restaurant is attractive, comfortable, and spacious, and the tables are nicely arranged so that one is not on top of the next party.  I wish that more Scoglio diners dressed in a manner that is befitting such a lovely establishment.

Tonight, my wife and I had the pleasure of being served by Tabitha.  She could not have been more efficient, attentive, gracious, pleasant, charming, and welcoming.  I cannot count the number of times she performed quality checks, refilled water glasses, ensured that we did not need anything, and let us know that our food would arrive soon (it was a long wait for our entrees this time, about 45 minutes, no doubt because the restaurant was packed).  We can also count on a warm and gracious welcome from owner Linda, one of the most hard-working and dedicated individuals in the local restaurant business.  Linda does whatever it takes to keep the operation moving, and at the beginning of its existence, she was our server on a number of occasions.  I am delighted that her hard work has paid off.

The Scoglio salad which accompanies entrees is a mixed green assortment with tomatoes and cucumbers, the dressing a white balsamic vinaigrette, which is unique, excellent, and most certainly not fattening.

The Scoglio fried zucchini is a must for the lover of this dish, and there is none that is better anywhere.  Many restaurants serve a cheap imitation of this legendary Pittsburgh dish, not Scoglio.

My chicken parmigiana was delicious: a fine portion of three large pieces of tender chicken, served with tasty sauce, covered in cheese, with a side dish of fusili pasta in a tasty sauce: excellent.  

The fresh bread and butter complement the meal nicely.

My wife and I shared a pecan ball for dessert, and Tabitha did not just provide us an extra bowl and spoon; she separated it into two portions for us: great! 

Prices have risen a good bit since the restaurant opened, but it is not overpriced for the quality and quantity of the food and the ambience.  I can see where some would say that the restaurant's decor and furniture should be updated, but it suits me just fine.  It need not do anything to make it more appealing, in my view.

It is a place for the annual Christmas party where Barb in Finance gets tipsy and does karaoke or for the after work drink during which colleagues vent and tell each other how they really feel about the CEO.

Kay and I stopped in for dinner in the thick of the Yuletide Season, driving around for a few minutes before coming upon it (remember kids, Foster Plaza, Building #7). A holiday get-together was underway, so we were seated near the bar by a server with a Santa Claus hat and snowflake earrings on. We knew at that moment that we were in for a meal of Italian tradition and not fusion, tapas, or anything fussy or trendy. As my regular readers know, that's kosher with me.

A stunning house of cards that was Scoglio's take on fried zucchini was whisked past us, but due to its serving being intended more for five than two (I would have snapped a photo but wasn't fast enough) we instead went with a serving of Baked Rotolo to begin our supper. Spinach, ricotta, prosciutto, and mozzarella are rolled in a carpet of housemade pasta with a Farlenaise sauce. Some research indicates that the creamy, tomato-imbibed gravy is either a creation of the restaurant or another sauce (Alfredo? Bechamel?) modified or renamed. Regardless, this was essentially a successful hybrid of a Swiss roll and a ravioli with the salty-sweet ham rising above the cream of the cheeses and the mysterious sauce. An entree in itself, it almost seemed unfair for this to be considered an appetizer. 

The signature, house-dressed, feta-topped Scoglio Salad acted as a tangy, chilly, fresh, palate-wiping prelude to the Stuffed Sea Scallops, a quartet of thick, quivering mollusks filled with tuna salad's warm crustacean equivalent in Crabmeat Imperial. Dressed with a milky, chowder-ish spinach sauce, the newly captured scallops bled sea water, mingling with the flavors of the broiled crab and its lardy, hearty binder.

Dessert was a Pecan Ball Sundae garnished with seemingly fresh whipped cream (cream ruled everything around this meal let me tell you) and chocolate sauce, recalling fried ice cream with that crunchy, nutty, sugared shell that covered the globe of frozen vanilla. 

Despite our obvious non-affiliation with whatever businesses occupy Foster Plaza, Kay and I were absolutely doted on by our server as if we'd been dining there for years. On a cold, winter evening, we felt as if we had dropped in on a loving relative who didn't care that we were disheveled after having put in a hard eight and just so happened to have dinner ready with enough left over for the two of us. I half expected her to introduce us to everyone in the room. 

Scoglio's won't expand your tastes or cause upheaval in your personal culinary world. Rather, they'll merely charm you with smashing, impeccably realized renditions of the classics, and in an era of blurring innovation, a plate of truly  tasty, carefully homemade spaghetti is sometimes preferred over the next molecular gastronomy experiment.",19,12,14,False,7,525,0.044111630890210474

Chairs are cushioned - soft and comfortable but perfect for the tables. We even joked about buying similar ones for home. A large chandelier dominates the ceiling. Overall, the restaurant was warmly lit, clean and welcoming. 

My In-laws said they hadn't seen children at the restaurant before and called ahead to see if my 14 month old daughter was welcome.  And yes, the staff was fantastic with her. I'll think nearly every waitress stopped by to talk to her.  One even read her a couple pages from a story book.

Our service was great! The staff anticipated our needs by clearing plates and refilling drinks before we even realized we needed them. And I never felt like anyone was hovering over us. 

Food - again great! We started with calamari, which was the huge crowd favorite, and zuccinni. Both were good and huge. We had a table of 5 adults and the 2 apps were a little too much though you would never know it because we cleared the plates! We all ordered something different for an entree, and happily agreed that we would order the same again. 

Afterwards, the waitress took my left overs to the kitchen to wrap - rather than tossing me a box to do it myself. When I got home I noticed that she even covered the box with plastic wrap so it didn't spill in the car.

Date of Dining:09 May 2011

We went here on Mothers day because my mother had been here before and wanted to come back. The location is a little odd as its located in a business park in a business building, but th parking lot was full, so it must be good right! I will review this using several categories (1) Menu/Food (2) Atmosphere (3) Service (4) Overall

(1) Menu/Food: This was mothers day, so the menu was different from their normal menu, but had a good variety including Veal, Chicken, Pork, Fish, Pasta. I ordered the Veal, which was good and my grand mother had the same thing, she liked it as well. My wife, brother and mother ordered the crab stuffed chicken. My wife said it was ""OK"" and was a little dry. We had a couple starters, the fried zucchini and mushroom caps. They were both very good. The prices were reasonable $15-$19 per dish, and the portions were good. 

(2) Atmosphere: From what I understand, this is a newer restaurant, but to be honest, it looked like something that hadn't been updated since 1979. The furniture looked user, the carpet was dirty and it just reminded me of places we went when I was a kid in the 1970-80's. Very dark. It has a nice location on the hill, they should work on their interior and get some modern furniture. Why do Italian restaurants in American feel like they need ""Old"" looking furniture. Every restaurant I have been to in Italy is modern and updated. 

(3) Service: This is where they fell down....Although out waitress was very pleasant and nice to us, she was SLOW....Not just SLOW, but brutally SLOW. I did not think they were super busy as there were empty tables, so they cannot use them being busy as to why they were slow. I guess they are not normally open on Sundays, so maybe they had a problem getting staff, but come on, its mothers day. 

(4) Overall: The food was average, the atmosphere sucked, and the service was slow, so I honestly would not recommend this place unless you are over 60 as it might be a place you would enjoy. They need to modernize their restaurant, clean the carpet, get some new furniture, and improve their service. The menu can be more traditional northern Italian (their menu had a lot of southern Italian influence to it).",3,0,1,False,2,415,0.14481833792062326

Nowadays, I tend to use those free greenbacks for dinin' out!

With a bundle of belated X-Mas cash I received last night jolting me from my brief, economically-induced (consumer overboard!) Yelp slumber, Kay and I were on the hunt for more unreviewed plunder this frozen morning. I recalled that the Trolley Barn Eatery, another suburban shopping plaza enigma known only to local residents, had not yet been discussed. On a trillion occasions I've passed TBE during hours when (of course) they weren't open. A little research confirmed my theory that they were only open for breakfast and lunch. Further delving indicated that they were open only until 12:30PM on weekends. It was 11:15! Kay and I still had pajamas on and overnight crust in our eyes!

""Kay, we gotta go, NOW!"" I told my ladylove. 

""Damn you and your Yelping,"" she grumbled back at me. 

As we strolled in, we immediately noted the interior scenery, which is appropriately trolley-themed. Vintage signs that appeared to have been lifted from scrapyards line the walls as an ""I"" beam that runs across the ceiling. Black and white photos of Pittsburgh streetcars from ages ago hang above your heads as you indulge. 

Noting us in this secret hashery were the regulars who ranged from elderly couples to gaggles of teenagers. The lively, amusing conversation seemed to stand still in the nearly overloaded bean wagon for several seconds once we were seen. 

Heads turned...smiles formed. 

Waiting to be seated, a helpful white-haired woman advised me, ""Hon, you gotta go up front, order and pay there, gather your own silverware, THEN take a seat. That's how they do it here."" 

We both made our way through the narrow dining room, dodging fellow patrons who only patted me on the shoulder and chuckled when I bumped into them. 

""We've never been here before,"" I explained to someone. 

""OHHHH, you're gonna be back,"" she replied.

Once I placed our order, we sat near the entrance, getting up only to hold the front door open for someone in a wheelchair who was leaving, the warm atmosphere keeping the winter chill from affecting me. 

Not knowing what in tarnation to order, I simply went for a burger. Since they were still primarily in breakfast mode, I had to settle for homefries as a side, but for dessert, it was an abundant helping of sliced-down, buttered Pecan Roll. 

A classical diner burger, the top of the roll was as crooked as a wino's hat, and the attendant bacon strip stuck out as if said drunkard was giving me a good-natured raspberry. Flanked by doubloons of dill pickles, its cold, fresh l-t-o, and fluffy bun were held in place with a decorative toothpick. The patty could have been a little juicier, however, but I suspect that fears of trichinosis keep these burgers from being cooked less than well-done or medium. Nonetheless, I moderately enjoyed and hardly finished my hard-luck, hardscrabble burger. 

The home fries appeared to have been cut from Red Gold or Norland Red taters and came in magnanimous chops. 

""We gave yinz extra, for both of yinz,"" the greying cook told us as he brought out the broiling hill of spud on a large, alabaster porcelain plate. Rich, nutty, and slightly sweet, I had to take half of them away in a container for later, the helping proving to be too much for my stomach to hold. 

The aforementioned pecan roll should be renamed pecan toast. The whipped butter almost spread itself onto each crispy, caramelized tile within which I'd get a toothful of an occasional drupe nugget.

For just $21 and some change (pre-tip), it astonishes me how much food we both recieved for our money. Again, generosity seems to be TBE's forte, their stock and trade if yinz will. You'll pay a pittance and get a fortune in return, not only in terms of the food but the colorful, wisened clientele and service as well.

""Dont forget us next time yinz feel like eatin' aht,"" our waitress said as we departed, matriarchally putting a purple sheet of a menu in my hand for future reference. The room that was packed upon our arrival was now almost empty.

""Too bad we're closin' for the day. Yinz coulda had the whole room to yerselves!""

God bless places like Trolley Barn Eatery.

P.S. The menu board behind the cash register and counter said ""FREE ENTERTAINMENT -- $0""

P.P.S. Our small table couldn't hold all the food! Luckily, a table next to us was unoccupied. ""Yinz got a banquet goin' on over there?"" A fellow customer inquired.

P.P.P.S. Since TBE has no official website, and putting up menu links in the listings that do not originate from a restaurant's website is unallowed, here's a link to TBE's menu from the official website of Castle Shannon, the neighborhood this diner is located in...

Walking in you are greeted by the neighborhood sports bar vibe.  Especially since I came here during the Pirates game.  The bar was lined by what looks liked regulars and Pirates fanatics.  Some high top tables lined the perimeter of the room making for getting a seat a bit of a task, but once seated we were fine.  At the time we were there, we basically did it all ourselves.  We had to go to the bar to ask for menus and back to the bar to order.  The food was delivered to the table, but by the looks of it, and with how busy it was here, they only had the bartender working at that point.  That's not to detract from the fact that we received amazing service and that bartender was one bad ass.  She gave it right back to the regulars and kept it moving.

I ordered the bacon cheeseburger and he got a meatball hoagie.  I wasn't expecting much from a bar burger but I ended up surprised.  The patty was thick and juicy, cooked to your liking.  Topped with cheese and expertly cooked bacon.  Lettuce and tomato on the side so you can add if you like, nice move as to not water down the bun before diving in.  Condiments are giving to you prior so you can put as much of any condiment you like on your burger.  Each burger/sandwich is served with house potato chips.  They were amazing as well.  I still cannot figure out what the seasoning was that topped these, but they were amazing.  As for the meatball hoagie, it was HUGE.  Three big meatballs covered in marinara and cheese.  Satisfying?

Wow you would be wrong!! Visited this place last night from high Yelp reviews - so glad I did! First of all, the place is exceptionally clean- something I was very happy to see especially because it is mainly a bar! Even with having a large bar, pool tables, and poker machines, it is clean and inviting. There are many large flat screen tvs in the dining area - I would say 8 or so. All are modern and have a great picture quality. 
The menu is comprised of fried appetizers, sandwiches, pizza, and Italian dinners. I was in a pasta mood so I opted for the spaghetti and meatballs (I added a picture to the restaurant listing)- a deal at 8.99, although a side salad is about $3-4 more- it is worth the money with roasted red peppers, chickpeas, olives, tomatoes, and croutons.
My boyfriend opted for the prosciutto and arugula thin crust pizza (picture has been added to the gallery)- it was a feast for the eyes and the stomach - would highly recommend.
The other star of the night was the spicy garlic parmesan wings. WOW. I first discovered this sauce when I was in college (one of the local pizza shops created a delicious take on it) and have since not been able to find to mimic the wings I loved so much. They knocked this sauce out of the park! If you like spicy, but not too spicy, with a good tang, give them a try. They cooked the wings perfectly with a nice crunch on the outside skin.

I've visited for drinks and pool a few times in the past, but dined there for the first time this weekend. I expected standard bar food and was super impressed by the homemade quality of everything we ordered.

After 8pm, they have a special low-price menu with $4 appetizers,$5 sandwiches and burgers, and a great wing and pitcher special. We ordered both appetizers to share amongst the group. The provolone wheel was literally a round of provolone breaded, fried, and topped with sauce. Best eaten by just digging in with a fork, it is melty cheesy goodness. The tomato sauce was spot on as well, just sweet enough to cut through the richness of all the cheese. The fried zucchini was the real surprise - amazingly light, crispy breading with a mild seasoning. I've never really liked fried zucchini because it tends to get soggy and limp. I don't know what their secret is, but I would order this fried zucchini every time!

For my meal I enjoyed the burger with american cheese. It was juicy with a nice chargrilled flavor (reminded me of a good quality Burger King patty haha, I mean that as a compliment!) and the toppings were fresh. A solid burger. My hubby quickly devoured the meatball sub so I didn't get a chance to try it, but he was impressed. We both enjoyed the homemade fries that accompanied the sandwiches - spice blend game strong.

The bartender that's usually working is super sweet and makes sure that nobody waits too long for a drink. The owner is an awesome guy as well. Always comes out to say hi to the regulars and introduces himself to anyone that he doesn't recognize. Overall, a really great local bar/restaurant.",2,0,0,True,16,293,0.10893290055796488

We were the only ones in the dining room. The bartender came to give is menus and to take our drink orders. She was very nice and explained what the dinner special was. A few minutes later the owner or head chef came to our table. He was really funny. He had a very thick Italian accent. He told my husband to try the special and told me I should try the lemon chicken. His name was Lou and he takes food seriously. 
My husband ordered the special-Chicken Chiu Chiu pasta. It was grilled chicken, sliced banana peppers, mushrooms, and rigatoni noodles. It sounds pretty simple but whatever they put in the sauce was absolutely delicious. I am not able to eat spicy food so while this dish carried a little heat I could have eaten it. I was bummed I had not ordered it myself. 
I ordered the Lemon Chicken and was pleasantly surprised. Usually Lemon chicken has a lemon sauce that only has a hint of lemon. Because of that I asked if it came with capers. The waitress told me no but that they would put some on for me. Once I tasted the dish I realized that the sauce was so good that it didn't need capers. It was the best Lemon Chicken I had ever had. The portion size was huge. 
It was a surprise that my meal was just chicken-no sides or even a salad. Even though my order was all chicken I took half of it home. My husband's dish came with garlic bread but no sides or salad. He took 1/3 of his home.

The veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly, fried gently. Very flavorful.  The meatballs, delicious.  The spaghetti sauce, sweet and incredibly flavorful.  We both had the wedding soup, and my only regret was that I didn't order a bowl.  Broth, escarole, carrot, meat....a classic done superbly well.

We each had an alcohol drink, one wine, one beer.

Louie, the owner, was there. He spied us immediately and wanted to know our story. Apparently this is a place for regulars. We fit right in. This guy is THE MAN.

Who knew they had a nice, and spacious dining room in the back, complete with a big flatscreen TV? 

I really had no idea what to order as the dinner fare is typical upscale American/Italian; lots of seafood, steak, pasta, veal, and chicken dishes. 

A little cherub told me they had excellent meatballs, and I can't get enough ground meat, so I got the Spaghetti and Meatballs. 

My only errr...beef about it was that I only got two meatballs, but they were as fat, flavorful, and rich as any I have ever had. One more would have been nice though.  They are generous with the spaghetti, which is al dente, thick like bass strings, or Todd McFarlane's rendition of Spidey's webs. Tom DeFalco, Editor In Chief of Marvel at the time and Italian himself, called it ""spaghetti webbing."" Moonlite Cafe's spaghetti is why. 

The sauce was THROUGH THE FLOORBOARDS! So was the juice that seeped to the bottom of the plate. I used to wonder why some people refused to eat spaghetti sans bread. What else are you gonna sop up all that delightful mess left behind with?

My friend let me taste the Moonlite Ziti, and it was very garlicky with nice bits of tomato adorning the plate. 

The salad I ordered came with an atomic house dressing too.

Here we are and I'm writing this review at 7:43 PM and Travis has not shown up or even given a courtesy call. If this is how the consultations are handled I can only imagine how the move would go!! (cont..)

7/31/2018, 9:28 PM(My reply to his comment)
I understand that we are all human and things happen. That's the main reason I rescheduled the consultation. If I had not contacted you yesterday, you would not have followed up with me. The only reason I heard anything today is because of my unfavorable review. Instead of taking ownership of your mistake and trying to rectify it, you chastise me for telling the truth about my experience with your company. You could have won way more customers over by saying: I apologize but I was stuck at a job due to the rainstorms. If you would like to give me another chance, I would like to make this right. Sometimes you can take a negative and change it into a positive.

They are uniquely clever with a Pittsburgh flavor.  Some refer to our sports heroes (and losers), some reference our neighborhoods while others just display sayings or pictures that can only be described as Pittsburgh.  I bought what I'm calling the list of bridges shirt that I will proudly wear, both here when I'm out and about but mostly when I'm out of town.

I had a very nice time here with my travel partner.  She was much more interested in skating, and I just went along for the joke of me being on iceskates.  Ones that don't fit quite right to boot.  

Get there early because evenings seem to get busy.  The tree is all lit up and festive, and by 7pm, the line was WAY long.  Longer than I would be willing to wait in line.  

Anyways, let's get down to the pros and cons:
Cons (let's get them out of the way first)
* Only one toilet for women. You're going to wait in line.  Unless there are some hidden stalls somewhere?
* Crowds and conditions - when you have that many people skating, the ice conditions are not great.  The ice itself is gouged up.  I mean, I know Pittsburgh is a hockey town, and the kids are really good at skating, but they tear it up.  Zamboni does come out, but after just 15 minutes, the conditions were terrible again.  And you're going to crash into someone, or they will crash into you. Multiple times.... mostly by little kids or newbies.
* Skate rentals - eh.  They just never fit right.  There's no sense buying your own when you're a casual skater, but boy do these things cramp your style and your baby toe.

Pros
* Nice atmosphere - really the tree and lights and music.  It's nice.
* Concessions.  Not over-priced in my opinion.  At least not in comparison to other places I've been.
* Staff - super helpful and even willing to take photos of young couples on dates.  Now that's service.
* Plenty of seating.  Lots of outdoor seating for people like me who can only be on the ice for like 5 minutes at a time in those terrible rental skates.... 

But really, I think this is a great asset for downtown Pittsburgh.  It's a great spot for locals, and definitely a great place for visitors too.",1,0,2,True,13,340,0.11512108629175499

I havent been skating or to this rink since i was about 16, so i was super excited. Bobby is from Florida and said he hasnt been ice skating since he was 5 and was superrrr nervous!

Five minutes later, he was skating backwards and looking like a pro, while i looked like a baby penguin who had just hatched. 

We enjoyed an hour of skating. Phew i forgot how bad skating made your feet hurt! 

The rink is really nice and the ambiance of the city adds a great touch. This is not a pricey date by any means.. $11 per person if you're renting skates ($8 admission, $3 skate rental) They have lockers to rent for 50 cents both in the admission area and concession area.

- Service - 3 stars.   Lots of staff, but they aren't well coordinated and don't really put a lot of thought into it.  I returned the first pair of skates because the clasp piece was broken off.  The second pair came out and I sit down to find they have the same problem.

This past Saturday, the rink was more crowded than I had ever seen it before. It could have partly been due to the unseasonably warm weather we seem to be having on the weekends this year, but anyways, there was a huge line and it looked as if they were letting people in systematically rather than anyone who buys tickets can start skating. Prices are reasonable as is the skate rental. This is a solid family activity and, I imagine, would be an extra special treat for any kids coming down to the gingerbread house to see Santa.

We were in Pittsburgh for the weekend and were working our way down Carson Street, bar by bar.  This was our 1st stop.  We could only stay for 1 drink because we had a pregnant girl that was with us (not drinking), and the place allowed smoking. 

We had just missed the live band, and didn't get to try any of the food, so I can't speak on behalf of either of those.  

Place was a good size with plenty of room to move around.  The crowd there was mainly older (40s & 50s).   But with all the room, I was disappointed there was no pool table/dart board.   

The men's bathroom didn't have a lock on the door and there was no divider between the toilet and the urinal.  This is a pet peeve of mine. Is it really that expensive to install a divider?  So if you go here, don't eat too many wings or you will need someone to stand guard as you use the bathroom.

Another small annoyance... On the way to the bar we picked up a few bottles of water to bring back to the hotel with us and they made us check in the water and leave it at the entrance.  What is that all about?

My friends and I are on a quest to find the best wings in the 'burgh (and when I say 'burgh, I mean the city... we ain't driving to Monroeville for any wings!) and upon googling ""best wings in Pittsburgh,"" Excuses came up as NUMBER TWO.  We thought we had struck gold (GOLD, Jerry, GOLD!).

We had struck nothing more than a horse apple (ref: Shawshank Redemption).

Admittedly, we messed up and showed up on Thursday (versus Wednesday) for wing night.  Our bad.  However, one would think that the wings served on Wednesday are the same as the wings served on Thursday.  If they ARE different, I'll happily try this place again.

Anyway, I walk into a cloud of smoke.  I hate to be a pain about this, but isn't there a law against cigarette smoke in an establishment that serves food (they even have a dining room!)?  This was my first turn off.  I guess I'm ""spoiled"" by having been able to eat in fresh air.

We claim a table in the back dining area and immediately start checking out the menus - which, btw, were placed neatly on each table.  The bartender comes up and tells us that they are on a ""late night"" menu (WHAT?  It was 7:20pm) and the menus we're looking at are basically just a tease.

OK.  I took a deep breath (coughed) and moved on.

""So, do you have wings?""  I ask.
""Oh yes, we have wings.""  Says our server (also the bartender, and worth a mention, very nice and timely with drinks/etc.)
PHEW
""But we only have one flavor.""
WHAT?!?

Normally this would be the third strike, but since the googles said they had the NUMBER TWO WINGS in Pittsburgh, we just figured they would be worth it.

So my group of five decides to tread cautiously and we get 2 dozen wings (hot wings, as that was the only flavor available).  FIVE SECONDS LATER the wings were there.  I'm not exaggerating.  There is quick, and then there is WAY TOO QUICK.  Basically, it was clear to us that these were wings from last night that were either nuked or had been sitting under a heat lamp for a while.

It gets worse.  They were good sized wings, but since they were ""leftovers"" all the fat was soft and chewy on the wings.  And inside, some of the meat was still pink.  This is a no-go with chicken.  I won't even go into detail on the brown, dried up celery...

The story ends with us not finishing the wings, heading over to Emiliano's across the street and having a grand ol' time with margaritas and nachos.

So much nostalgic here! They have both an outdoor serving area as well as an indoor one along with a bench if you wish to eat outside.

The ice cream here is home made and consist of your traditional flavors. They serve both hard and soft ice cream here and yes you are permitted to sample them. There is a $.50 off checkin bonus for a brownie boat. This consists of your choice of either a traditional brownie, a chocolate and pecan brownie, or a chocolate cheesecake brownie topped with two scoops of ice cream and of course whipped cream. I also had a choice of hot fudge or caramel topping. I settled for hot fudge.

After sampling the flavors I decided to opt for the peach and butter almond ice creams. When I received it I didn't realize the ice cream was so huge for small scoops! So I had to take it to the ""fountain"" so I could sit in front of the soda jerks and enjoy my treat. It was very good. Believe me I'm glad I opted not for the whipped cream because I was stuffed!

The lady who waited on me was friendly and helpful. I inquired as to why this place is cash only. She explained that since most of the purchases are under $10.00 she is charged a small fee for using a credit card so it is easier for her to charge by cash. She also informed me that the cost of vanilla ice cream has increased so she is trying to keep the costs down.

Although everything in here is nostalgic nothing really works. It would be a great touch to have a juke box playing inside but there is so much to look at you really get the feel for being back in the 50s.

They also have another side where you can purchase cake and candy supplies.
When I was finished the lady brought out some wet naps so I could get the chocolate off. if you eat indoors you are served your dessert in a glass dish which you can leave on the table for them to clean up.

Due to the weather, we dined inside this time, finding ourselves transported backwards in time to a kitschy 1950's ice cream parlor complete with stools, a long counter, cheap candy, and...a mannequin???

This trip, I decided to go with something called the Chocolate Covered Banana Royale Sundae (???), and go with it I did, allowing it to take me to realms of dark desire. 

The housemade (!) vanilla ice cream was coated with a chocolate that hardens when it meets cold. Served in a traditional glass dish, banana medallions were strewn about, an amazing (also housemade?) hot fudge rocked my pleasure centers with subtle richness, and a mound of whipped topping helped keep things from getting out of hand.

I stepped up and finally did business here this afternoon with a friend after flying past it myriad times on my travels. 

Bruster's has a rival for best brownie sundae. S&S calls theirs The Brownie Boat. 

Imagine being taken down the river Styx and your deathful dessert being served to you by Charon himself or one of his minions. My date with confectionery desire came with Butter Pecan and something I think was called Cheesecake Crunch (my choices), not to mention whipped cream to cut the sweetness (darkness) and that living hot caramel fudge that almost crept off of the table. 

Then there was the brownie itself which had to have been freshly baked by some infernal harpy and blessed with an inverted cross.

We ate outside on a bench, and luckily the rain was held at bay. 

""In a place just south of Witches' Valley 
Where they say the rain won't fall...""

Ronnie Dio called it. 

We looked inside, and it was as retro as everyone has described it to me.

Anton Szandor LaVey, high priest of The Church of Satan, had a 50's fetish so I've been told. 

There was a mannequin sitting in there. 

LaVey had mannequins all over his basement bar according to a Rolling Stone interview from about 20 years ago. 

Each visit to S&S might as well be a black mass in an ice cream parlor.

I asked if she could make it shorter and she told me that if it would be any shorter my bottom would be hanging out.

I waited 2 weeks for my dress which was fine because I gave myself enough time before the party . I went in and tried the dress on and IT FIT PERFECTLY!

With that being said, I am not much of a fan of Dr. Bollens. We recently brought our new puppy, Eva, to North Boros, who was suffering from severe itching. He basically brushed off my concern, stating that it ""might just be the way she is."" I completely understand that some dogs may itch more frequently than others, but I also know when my dog appears uncomfortable and is itching because of an issue. I told him that she broke open some areas of skin. Dr. Bollens didn't even look at her or look for the areas where her skin was cut/scratched open. He dismissed my concerns and gave the vaccines and that was that. Eva was bleeding from her chest that very same night due to the itching.

Needless to say, we were back in a few weeks later due to Eva itching and licking bald spots on her fur. This visit, the vet decided to administer an antibiotic and tried to get a scraping to test for mange, but could not get the scraping done due to Eva's squirming. It seemed like a giant guessing game, which did not make me feel very comfortable or confident with their treatment plans (a shampoo that does not require a prescription that they charged $30 for when I could have gotten it for half the price on Chewy).

We unfortunately had to switch vets for Eva because I did not like this whole guessing game. The new vet was able to complete a scraping without issue,and provide me with plenty of explanations and projected game plans for treatment.

My dog is pretty anxious, and I was really nervous and worried to bring him because I have recently rescued him from a shelter and have never experienced taking him to the vet before and was going in pretty blind. 

I live on 5th avenue in the city and there were plenty of other vets and hospitals I could've taken him too within walking distance from my home but they all had relatively horrifying reviews, ranging from animal negligence to providing the wrong prescriptions. 

I'm sitting in my car with my dog reading these reviews trying to decide where I should take him and I came across this location and it had perfect reviews, even though there were only 12 the reviews all mentioned fairs costs and great services. 

I was seen very quickly for being a walk-in appointment because I didn't call ahead. The women at the desk were all very kind. Like I said my dog is kind of anxious and sometimes doesn't do well with other dogs so just to be safe I waited with him outside near the front and they were ready for me like I said almost instantly and she came out and got us. 

The vet was awesome. I think his name was Ian maybe but he was really thorough. He looked through my dogs medical records provided to me from the shelter and went over all of the possibilities of what could be going on in detail as well as going further with what shots and vaccinations he may need coming up which I had no idea about. 

Came down to him just having this apparently very common hot spot, which the vet gave him a steroid shot and treated the area with something else as well. Prescribed him two medications for two weeks and total visit cost was $200. Which I think is fair? I honestly have no idea but I felt that was reasonable for the service and the medications. Again idk. I'm pleased though. 

The lady at the desk printed out copies of everything that was done during the visit so that I can submit it to my pet insurance company and the vet who worked with my dog hand wrote everything we discussed which was really helpful.

Because Trader Joe's only carries their own brand, and Whole Foods carries more specialty brands, I find myself at Market District for things like Pop-Tarts, Frank's Red Hot Sauce, Just (vegan) Mayo, Jamaica's Finest Ginger Beer, etc. 

Yet, no matter the time of day, or time of year, this place is impossible to shop in a timely manner. For anyone needing something quick - fuhgeddaboutit - it won't happen. Go pay more at Rite Aid - you'll save yourself the frustration.

If you go early-early in the morning or late at night, only Self-Checkout lanes are available, and they are the touchiest and fussiest machines to date. They will most likely start blinking and acting up; and then you have to wait for an invisible associate to come help you. 

If you go when there are checkout lanes open, even though there are close to 20 lanes, only two will be operating during the busiest times of the day, and there is hardly ever a bagger present anymore. Though Trader Joe's trades lower prices for bagging things for yourself, you pay more at Giant Eagle, for slow checkouts and also bagging your own stuff. (Because if you wait for the cashier, it will cost you in doubling your time at checkout).

Their vegetarian and vegan brand options are also something to be desired. An item is there one day, and then it disappears and is gone forever. Until I find it at Whole Foods.

Giant Eagle is my last resort for when I'm done shopping at Trader Joe's and Whole Foods. But the most annoying thing, is even when I shop at all of these stores in one day, it still takes me longer to get 2-3 items at Giant Eagle, than it does for me to get the majority of my groceries at the two other major stores.

I like that they have a pharmacy, and Citizens Bank and Starbucks and beer it's convenient being able to do multiple stuff in one stop.

The bad: The bathroom is always dirty, there's always water on the sink in floor.  And for such a HUGE store, why is there only 1 toilet in the men's room?

It's very overpriced.  Aldi is much, much cheaper, it's not even close.  Like eggs are twice the price at Giant Eagle, bread is often 3 times the price at Giant Eagle.  I could go on and on, everything at Giant Eagle is more expensive, compare the prices yourself.  Whole foods is the only grocery store in Pittsburgh that's more expensive than Giant Eagle, but not by a lot.

The cashiers are sooo slow, and there are never enough of them.  I've never been to this location and not had to wait in a line.

Why are there like 7 different types of flooring in the store, carpet, wood floor, tile floor, brick floor, cement floor, different tile floor...  Feels weird and cheap and incomplete.  Feels like they started construction and they half way through changed their mind several times.  Or feels like they ran out of materials and just switched to a different type at random.  Just pick one or maybe two floor types and stick to it.

I don't like the advantage card gimmicks.  Why make your customers have to jump through all these extra hoops to save money?  Why not just give everyone a fair price???  Stuff like ""buy one get one half off"" why?  Why force us to buy more than we want or need to save money?  People think they're saving money with Fuelperks, but they're simply not, when you add up the extra price you pay to for food to begin with, you're still spending more at the end of the day, and now you have to carry an advantage card with you everywhere and it's another thing for you to remember and keep track of.  And now you have to wait in line even longer for people to scan their advantage card and use coupons and stuff.  The ""deals"" and coupons just create extra work and waste everyone's time, it's a make-work job.

I really like this Market District! I come here to work often because the internet works great and the atmosphere is nice. There are big windows that let in a lot of natural light (when not covered by clouds), and this puts me in a good mood! 

There's a not-Starbucks-but-is-Starbucks area. You can use your app to pay and gain stars but you cannot redeem a birthday drink (insulting on your birthday, let me tell you!). No blonde espresso, but it's still good. 

You can also order food and have it delivered to your table. It's really nice, and they have good food! 

There is a strange phenomenon in the seating area. My favorite place to sit is at one of the 4 large high top areas by the giant windows. When this place first was remodeled, I came and all chairs were at the tables (4 large tables with 6 chairs at each table) . . . but every time I come, I notice these chairs are slowly disappearing. They have never returned. I've almost lost sleep over this. There are no other tables to which these chairs could be placed because these are the only high top tables. It's very bizarre. As I type this, 10 chairs are missing. I would assume next time I visit, 11 or 12 will be missing. So, if you want to sit at one of MY favorite tables in this Market District, I believe you realistically have 2-4 months before there is nowhere to sit. 

No one working at this Market District seems to care this is happening. The absurdity of the situation is almost unbearable. And, it's a shame because people SHOULD BE sitting at these tables. Why? Because they're Amish-made. And, the Amish are detail oriented. These are wood tables. And what happens with wood and pants? I'll tell you... snags. But Amish wood tables? No snags. Why? Because if you look under the tables you will see a large white vinyl sticker over the bottom to protect your pants from snags. I mean, that kind of intentionality is remarkable and to be noticed, praised, and utilized. 

That cannot be done if there are no chairs. 

Someone needs to solve this.

There is only a revolving door in the cafe (beer area). If you do any grocery shopping before you buy your beer, you have to schlep your cart into the cafe, then back out to another part of the store to exit.

Unfortunately I was hoping to get home with enough time to get a few things done before a YELP event tonight. 

Not ok. Sitting in the car w a toddler who has to wait for Curbside is not a good experience. Bringing two dogs anticipating a normal curbside experience, even worse.

After others were serviced, curbside realized my groceries and I were still waiting. They claimed the stormed caused a glitch to the system which made pulling up some orders difficult.

However, over the experience was bad. W a glitch I would still expect a phone call letting me know there was a Delaney.

This Market District has a nice, spacious parking lot (unlike its even-closer-to-the-city counterpart in Shadyside). It's on a bus line as well.

The produce department is well-stocked with lots of fresh goodies (and some pretty awesome sales from time to time - BOGO cauliflower? heck yes!). They have a charcuterie section that carries meat from Parma Sausage in the Strip District, as well as some other specialty meats from the Piggery in New York.

Be sure to check out their huge flavored popcorn section. You don't have to wait for that boy scout popcorn sale at Christmas; you can get a ton of awesome flavors here (pizza! pizza flavored popcorn!) in ginormous tubs all year. 

I swear they make the best chocolate chip cookies of any of the Giant Eagles I shop at. So soft and chocolatey.

I like the variety of local and/or antibiotic-free meats that they carry here, and I'm a big fan of the way they are being more eco-conscious with their enclosed cold dairy section.

The grand opening was January 22, 2015. Now that the word is out about the place being finished it is always packed and finding a parking space can be a chore.

I just don't understand why it took Giant Eagle so long to turn this location into a Market District. They are headquartered in the Fox Chapel/ O'hara Township area after all.

It's set up pretty much just like the somewhat larger Robinson location. For people who don't know, The Market District is a more upscale part of Giant Eagle, a supermarket chain based in Pittsburgh.

The best way to describe this place is Whole Foods, Trader Joe's, Wine & Spirits, Walgreen's and The Strip District all in one place! 

Take the cheese section for example. Every type of cheese you could think of and even some you have never heard of. Not sure what a particular cheese tastes like? No problem, they will give you a free sample.

The amount and quality of the meat department is just mind blowing. Everything from beef to lamb, pork, chicken and so much more! Need some spices for the meat you just purchased? No problem. There is a spice and olive oil section. Vegan or prefer to dine Gluten Free? The Market District has that covered as well.

The seafood section is just as massive covering just about the entire ocean.

There is also a ethnic area that covers just about the entire globe including Italy, Germany, Spain and Africa. If you don't want to cook and bring home a quick dinner then check out the Cafe. The cafe has every type of food you can imagine. A pizzeria, a hibachi station, Indian, Sushi, a quesadilla station, a coffee shop, gelatos, a salad bar just to name a few.

The bakery will even give Oakmont Bakery and Bethel Bakery a run for their money. Lots of different cakes, cookies, pies, doughnuts and so much more.  

There is even a cosmetic section that carries all the hard to find skin care products like Bare Minerals and Aveeno.

I like this Market District location better than the East Liberty/ Shadyside location because it is closer to my house and the aisles here are bigger and finding a parking space is nowhere near as hard.

I don't know why Pittsburgh has allowed Giant Eagle to basically have a monopoly on groceries in this city. Yeah, sure, we have some smaller niche grocers and a few low-cost players that have moved into town recently, but let's face it -- in the all-encompassing big supermarket space, there really is no true competition. The market pretty much belongs to Giant Eagle. What I wouldn't give for Wegman's to expand into the Burgh...but I digress.

Limited competition means that Giant Eagle stores can be consistently subpar and people will shop there anyway. Ok, so to be fair, this Giant Eagle isn't among the worst locations as far as Giant Eagles are concerned -- the South Side and Squirrel Hill locations that I used to frequent take that honor. So I'll give this location an extra star for not being the suckiest of a sucky chain of stores. But even this supposed 'nicer' Giant Eagle still doesn't cut it in the grand scheme of supermarkets.

My main beefs? First and foremost (and this applies to all GEagles) -- the prices. The prices are downright insulting. Yeah, yeah, sometimes they have sales (oh boy, how nice of them!), which take their sky-high prices and bring them down to what most other grocery stores would charge on a normal day. So I hope that your shopping list contains nothing but items on ""sale,"" because otherwise you're out of luck. 

Second, this location seems to consistently be out of stock of basic items every time I come in here. Just yesterday I went in for two things -- baby spinach and sandwich wraps. Two things. And BOTH items were out of stock. I'm sorry, I know that it's the weekend and it's busy, but how about you try to keep up with demand? Is that too much to ask? This is not the first time I've gone in for just a few items and have left without them because the shelves were empty. For a store the size of Giant Eagle, I expect more.

Third, I've personally had issues with meat quality here. Specifically, I've found their Nature's Basket chicken breast to be consistently tough and stringy -- almost inedible. The first time, I thought maybe I just got a bad batch. The second time, I started to get suspicious about the quality. And the third time (several weeks later) when it still had the nasty texture issues, I vowed to never buy chicken there again (and I haven't). As a dubious ex-president once said, ""Fool me once, shame on me. Fool me -- you can't get fooled again.""

Lastly, I've had some really poor customer service experiences at this location. For example, the latest instance came about a month ago. When we went to check out, my hubby put his basket on the conveyor belt without emptying it. Now I used to work at a grocery store when I was a teenager, and I would get frustrated when people were too lazy to put their items on the belt. It's annoying, I get it. I really do. But my hubby didn't know any better. And when this would happen to me as a cashier (which was often), I would smile and take the items out of the basket one by one and scan them (albeit secretly cursing the customer in my head). But Kayla, our cashier? She gave a pissed-off sigh, rolled her eyes....and then literally took the basket, held it pointedly up about a foot or two over the belt, and deliberately dumped it upside down so everything came crashing down at once. We had some fragile things in there (strawberries, blueberries, and eggs) that were damaged from the impact. Completely unacceptable!

Sigh. I have countless additional stories about how awful Giant Eagle is, but my fingers are getting tired, and if Yelp doesn't already have a word limit, they would probably consider putting one into place if I keep going.  :)  

Ok, one last thing, and then I'm outta here, I swear. They are currently renovating this location to be a Market District (slated to open in early 2015), so we can all look forward to that. Sorry, GEagle, but you ain't foolin' anyone -- you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig.

We don't get paid in free games or anything like that. We are just enthusiasts. We judge rooms based on production value (how nice the room is/theme/ambiance/prop quality/storyline etc), puzzles (do they make sense, are they logical, do they fit the theme, etc), and a few other random things.

Of all of the rooms I have been to, this venue is by far the best venue with the best rooms. There's many reasons for this, but if you are looking for a room to do in Pittsburgh area, or are willing to drive a reasonable distance, book the room and then come back and finish reading.

Here are all the great things about the place:

- Every employee takes their job seriously and they never come out of role. This goes from the moment you check in until the moment you leave, and during the briefings. At first I thought it was really hokey, and most people do the first time they hear it, but at the end of the day, it really adds value.

- The venue, once you get past the sign in area, is just positively amazing. It looks like it could be a movie set or a disney set that they have while you wait in line (if you been inside some of the rides that have decorations and props while you wait to get you in the theme or mood, you'll understand what I mean here). 

- The rooms are huge. This is probably one of the only venues I've ever been to where the rooms can handle the amount of people they advertise for. I have taken 10 people to a room (usually our limit is 4-6 when going with friends, and 95% of the time we are playing by ourselves), us and eight more inexperienced players, and we had plenty to do and plenty of room to move.

- The sets are just amazing. I can't tell you enough how great they are. We are set to do Leviathan within the next couple weeks, but have done the other two...and the inventor's paradox in particular is just WOW.

- The puzzles make sense, they are logical, and they are not always easy. And that's important. They're not easy but they still make sense. I can make a lot of random puzzles that don't make sense, which inherently makes them more difficult, but that doesn't mean the puzzle is good.

- The themes are not your usual escape room tropes. They're completely original ideas, or at least ideas we have never seen elsewhere. You're not going to find Bank Heists, Hostage situations, and all the other typical themes you find everywhere else. 

If I had to complain:

- Sometimes when they give the clue, because they remain in role, it can be hard to understand what they are saying. They speak as if they are members of a cult, and sometimes I've had to ask them to repeat the clues. It's not worth taking a star away, but if they are reading this, just make sure you are really clear when you speak.",4,0,0,False,28,535,0.12098260968214404

I have wanted to go to an escape room for quite a while and I had some Grinch's who thought it wouldn't be fun.  (Oh the joy of having young adult children!). I picked the Imaginarium after doing a lot of research.  PEOPLE!  LISTEN TO ME!  If you really want the full immersion experience then THIS is where you need to go.  We had seven people in our group.  Once we pulled up we met another couple who said that they were going in with our group.  They were experienced escapees.  They had done over a dozen.  They loved doing them so they were going everywhere to do them.  Once everyone in our group arrived we buzzed into the building to let them know we were there.  We were told to enter.  I can't share anything after that because I signed a waiver saying that I wouldn't.  #truestorybro  This is what I CAN tell you.  , , ,we failed.   It wasn't for lack of trying.  Goodness me . . .we worked our tails off to tackle the clues.  Our group was made up of some pretty smart people.  HIGH IQs!!  I have to admit that had we not been grouped with that experience couple I don't think we would have made it far at all.  Afterwards they told us that this was the best but hardest one they had been to.  However, Once we got the hang of it our brains were worked to their capacity.  The gentleman who guided us through and gave little helps along the way did a fantastic job.  Oh, and those young adults ???  LOVED IT!!!!  In fact they want to go back and go through the other experience.  NOT EVEN KIDDING.  The Imaginarium has two experiences.  They change them every 8 months.  So GO!!!  Take your family, friends, and people you don't know.  I know it's only May but I'm thinking what a great Christmas gift for a family with older kids.  You could even take a group as a birthday celebration.  SO MANY OPTIONS. JUST GO!!!!!",2,3,5,True,23,391,0.1116232806435986

The puzzles were enough to keep 10 people busy for an hour. Time flies. Everyone shared in the solutions. There is plenty of space inside to spread out. Many rooms involved. We did the illusion escape. There is no countdown clock or pressure to hurry. 
A voice will come on the speaker now and then with extra clues if you get stuck too long. I think we got 3 extra clues total. It's very hard to understand any and all voice instructions from any of the audio sources. This would be fun for kids to see but I don't think they would contribute to the solutions.

                                                   By Ed Skirtich

     Hilarious events happened among joggers, walkers, and tennis players on an extremely hot day in August at Schenley Park Sportsplex. 

     As I turned the corner on the gray stoned pebbled track I saw a Caucasian man in his early 20's with a goatee and black hair wearing a black colored set of headphones totally oblivious to everything going on around him. Nothing bothered this guy. Men ran around the track with big dogs, and people either sprinted, jogged, or walked. The extreme 90 degree heat didn't bother him either.

    Another funny thing was a couple in their early 20's jogged. But they went so slow I passed them up on my roller walker both times I saw them on the large, gray- stoned oval. They shuffled their feet and it sounded like ""Tramp, tramp, tramp, tramp."" 

   Also, it was hilarious watching young men and women play tennis. Their boyfriends dominated the tennis games. They smacked the tennis balls over the net a couple times. Although suddenly, the tennis ball went right smack into the net. 

   But the tennis players never got upset. They just volleyed the ball again.

   On the benches underneath the small brown roof of a rest area, a young Caucasian lady appeared to be reading a  paperback novel. The funny thing about her and so many people are that they try to look intellectual but they never turn the page of the book their reading.",0,0,0,False,11,248,0.07319510035088435

If you let yourself, you could get completely lost here for a whole day and time would fly by.  Swim at the pool, visit the Conservatory, Bike the trails, party at a pavilion, play disc golf, run the track, explore deep in and participate in a mix of seasonal activities they hold for all ages.  I think if everyone came here one day a week the world would be a lot less violent and more understanding.

         All ages played tennis

         and no one shouted any menence.

          None of the kids cared if they were small

          because they kicked the soccer ball.
  
           Birds chirped and mated

           while other young couples walked, talked, and dated

As a student, it was the place I would go for fresh air and to clear my head - things I needed on a regular basis! Not that I'll pretend that I know my way around the entire park - there's 456 acres of trails, woods, and attractions in here!

Just a few highlights of the park and my experiences include:

*The trails in this park are a wonderful relief from the city. They're not really paved, though, so as obvious as it seems as I say it, don't stroll onto the trails for a leisurely walk - there's plenty of sidewalks along the roads that cut through the park for leisurely walks.

*Flagstaff Hill, near one of the park's boundaries, is a great place to sit with friends and watch the sun set - or see a movie during a screening in the summer.

*Just down the street from Flagstaff is the Schenley Park Café and Visitor Center, which is a great place to get a snack or beverage before or after strolling in part of the park.

*I know there's a pool, a golf course and an ice skating rink, as well as a couple playgrounds, in different locations throughout the park. I'd love to check them out one day! There's so much else to explore I've just never gotten to them.

*The park is pretty popular for joggers, nature lovers and major organizations alike; at different times of the year major events like the Grand Prix and Race For The Cure are held here. I myself have attended two events hosted by Invisible Children, Inc. and spent two nights asleep in tents and cardboard boxes in the park. Yes, really!

And that's just the tip of the iceberg! Overall I have to say I think it'll be pretty hard to find a park in the city any cooler than this one.

I miss the days when I lived within walking distance of Schenley - hopefully one day I'll move a little closer and will be able to stroll into this place at my leisure again!

I have a lot of fond memories of this park. It's the place where I used to take part in Komen Race for the Cure events with friends and family. It's also the place where friends and I took part in two major events that garnered media attention on an issue that's very important to me (I even slept in the park during those two events). In both of these cases, the park provided an excellent space to stand with a cause and bond with the people I love.

In addition to that, it's the place I'd go for exercise during my time as a student. Forget the gym: exploring the trails, walking by the lake in the park and enjoying the various views of the city and neighborhood helped me so much as a stressed-out college kid. It's always extremely peaceful on the trails here, and we are so lucky to have such a beautiful green space in Oakland.

If you go a little further into the part you'll find an ice skating rink, a swimming pool, playgrounds - I think there's an area people place golf somewhere in here as well...there's definitely something here for everyone in the surrounding area. I highly recommend that people take the time to explore the park - don't just look at it as ""that place I occasionally drive through"" or as part of your route home after work.

Schenley Park has all kinds of activites, no matter what your tastes.  They have swiiming, golf, ice skating, softball, tennis, and (in summer) movies.  But surprisingly, there's good hiking here too and you can get a rigorous hike in like my cousin and I did.  

We began our hike at the Panther Hollow Bridge, then picked up the Bridle Trail and looped on the Oval trail before picking up the Vietnam Veterans Trail and Loop.  That took us past the Vietnam Veteran's Shelter and Playground.  

Heading back up to Panther Hollow Bridge, we then took the Upper Panther Hollow Trail down to Bartlett Street.  We walked back via that trail towards the bridge and then took the steps down to Panther Hollow Lake.  After looping the lake, we then did the most rigorous part of the hike.  We explored  Schenley's forest interior by taking the Lower Panther Hollow Trail and returning on the Steve Faloon Trail via Westinghouse Pond.

After having worked up an appetite, we headed over to the Schenley Park Cafe (which see) to revitalize body and soul.  Schenley Park has all sorts of activities and it is really worth exploring.  Be sure to allow a whole afternoon.",2,1,1,False,1,260,1

Long story short: my former work-based insurance was canceled prematurely, and it took so long to get it reinstated that I literally had one day to use it before its original end date came around. My normal eye doctor couldn't take me on such short notice, and I had no idea when I would get the details of my temporary insurance plan (side note - I didn't get them until late fall). So I came to Visionworks for the first time ever.

To this store's credit, their staff are delightful. They worked their butts off verifying my insurance, helping me find great frames, and just generally making me feel better about the situation. I can't thank them enough for being patient and sweet in my time of frustration.

That said...their optometrist ultimately did not get my prescription right, which is kind of a big deal when you're getting new glasses. I did end up using the glasses from August through November, as the lenses weren't TOO bad and actually weren't off by that much. I could even work around the script's flaws with practically no trouble for a while. 

But as soon as I began reading extensively and continuously again (i.e. unable to schedule breaks to rest my eyes), that small deviation from what I needed unfortunately began a problem. So I headed to an eye doctor covered under my current insurance for an updated script; and they actually told me that places like Visionworks can sometimes make prescriptions TOO strong - go figure.

My final score for this review is an averaging out of the good and bad at Visionworks. Again, the staff here are very sweet, and if you have an existing accurate prescription I see no reason why you shouldn't buy glasses here if you fall in love with a pair. But I admittedly can't recommend their exam services, not after the imperfect script I received earlier this year.",6,1,5,True,15,334,0.10881070652148599

I made my appointment easily on their website for a Sunday which was awesome because I seldom am busy then! I got a few reminders and even the option to complete some medical history paperwork prior to coming in to save time.

I arrived 20 minutes early for my appointment and they hadn't yet opened. I waited until they lifted the gates and in walks a mother and two sons. I knew I was the first appointment so I didn't think much of it. Welp, they took them first for god knows what reason.

Unfortunately for me, the mother decided on this visit that she would teach her sons some responsibility and had them completing their forms on their own - which took at least 15-20 minutes (she also had them go into their exams on their own & they kept coming out to ask questions). Long story short- I waited at least 30 minutes past my appointment time to be seen. 

I brought my glasses with me because I'm blind as a bat & when they tell me to take my contacts out I can't see where I'm going. The tech noticed that I brought them & asked if she could take them to get a reading off of them. I said sure. She comes back 5 minutes later with my glasses, and hands them to me without making eye contact. I thought that was weird & she walked away. I go to put them on and they are COVERED IN SCRATCHES. And not 
scratches spread out - but isolated at the center of the lens in a circle pattern. I about lost it but I just wanted to get the hell out of there.

I was seen by Dr. Rose and she was fantastic! She was very informative and thorough and you can tell she knows what she's doing.

I ordered my contacts & they seemed affordable. I asked Alexis (a different tech) if she could mail them to me instead of me having to come in on a weeknight (tons of traffic) and she was more than willing to do so.  I spent almost two hours from start to finish but I chalk that up to the 2 sons 'learning to walk' at the eye doctor for the first time.

If it's the end of the year and you have money left in your flex spending account, buying a pair of glasses or sunglasses is a great way to use those funds.

The Lock and Dam had a sign out that said ice cream only which was fine since all that we wanted was ice cream. So my review really has nothing to do with anything else other than their ice cream.

The first thing that I will say is that the staff was pretty quick at getting people their orders. There was a slight line when we got there and we got served very fast compared to some other ice cream places that I've been to.

The Lock and Dam now has the option for an orange twist along with their vanilla, chocolate, and chocolate twist cones. They also have concrete's which are blizzard like ice cream desserts sundaes and other ice cream choices.

I was at first looking at the vanilla twist with some nut toppings but got swayed into getting the orange and vanilla twist. I will have to stay that their sizes are pretty large. Even when you get a medium it looks like a large, it feels like a large, and part of it is still in my freezer because the medium was a large for me.

My partner thought that the orange and vanilla twist tasted exactly like a push-up. But I thought that both the flavors kind of tasted like vanilla. The orange didn't have that orange twist punch that I am used to. The orange flavor was just a little too faint for me. But the vanilla was very good.

This shop is just down the street from us so we will probably come again. I look forward to just trying the vanilla cone and some of those concrete's.

It's in a totally unassuming store front across the street from the zoo- which is how my family and I ended up there. Post-zoo we were starving and my husband had heard that the food at Lock & Dam was supposed to be really good. I don't think he was prepared for HOW good it was, though. I certainly wasn't. 

My husband ordered a hot dog with mac n cheese on it, I ordered a Junkyard burger, and we ordered our two year old his very first cheeseburger. The first thing we noticed, when we brought the tray to the table, was that the food served for the price paid was beyond fair. Huuuuge burgers and dogs stacked high with premium toppings. I honest-to-G-d let out a satisfied moaning sound as a bit into this burger. I was like, beyond hungry at this point and I couldn't believe my good luck at what I was eating. Picky toddler even went HAM on his burger and, like I said, he has about five meals he will reliably eat... none of which are hamburgers lol.

The cherry on top of the experience was the business owner, who also cooked our food that afternoon. He was the most pleasant person who checked in with us about how we were enjoying our meal and genuinely seemed pleased that we thought it was so delicious. I don't want to blow up the spot, but he even gave us a couple little extras on the house that sweetened the experience even further.

There's really no question in our minds that we will be returning to have lunches at Lock & Dam every time we find ourselves having family day at the zoo. We have a zoo membership and spring and summer are right around the corner so I'm sure I'll be working my way through that burger menu.

I have had this place bookmarked for months and finally had a chance after running morning errands to finally hit this place up.

I arrived around the lunch hour and found this place to be nearly deserted.  I chalk that up to the fact that we have been having yo-yoing weather the past couple of days and maybe people take advantage of the outdoor seating.  When you walk in you are greeted by the old time diner vibe.  Those retro colors and chrome like accents are everywhere in here.  Ordering is an easy task to do, but being my first time here I took my time to look over the menu that changes.  Evidence of this is that the chalkboard menus that you see in these pictures are nothing like what they were when I was in here just a few days ago.

I will put this out there right now.  I did not try any other food items offered asides from the hot dog and fries itself.  So I cannot attest to things such as the Vienna all beef hot dog, hamburger or any of the ice creams (really wish I would have tried some ice cream especially since they have all the machinery to make a kick ass milkshake).  What I did end up trying here was the foot long hot dog combo.

The pricing here, at least to me, is by far better than most other places.  I see a lot of people complaining about the prices of a single hot dog.  I assume these people do not realize the quality of a hot dog definitely effects the pricing.  These aren't your common variety of grocery store hot dogs we are talking about here.  Also, maybe they should have tried the combo.

Speaking of the combo, one of the best combos I have come across in any restaurant I have come across (I mean, for a hot dog combo that is).  If you want, you can go plain Jane on your dog and top it with the traditional mustard or ketchup.  But I must implore upon you to try one of their topping combos that are already figured out for you.  I went with the Bacon Mac topping for myself.  It kind of takes you back to when you were younger and decided to add a hot dog to your mac n cheese.  So simplistic, yet satisfying.  It was a great thing that they served this with a fork, made for easy clean up of any of the toppings that fell off.  The fries had an amazing crisp to them.  No need for dipping because of how flavorful they were.  To round out the combo, pick from the cooler for any beverage you might want.  As for the price of the behemoth lunch, $8 and change.  AMAZING!  You almost had to roll me out of here after I finished this.

I think anyone who gave a negative review was just ornery or didn't understand how Square works. (See the person who complained that the restaurant somehow ""stole"" their email address...) I love hotdogs and have been searching Pittsburgh for the best hotdog spot for a while. I have been disappointed with the cleanliness, quality, consistency, and originality of every other place I've been to, including perennial favorites like Weiner World and that 24 hour place in Oakland. This place, however, was great from start to finish. It was clean. There's a great view. There was indoor seating. Even the bathroom was clean. The service was incredible. The staff was very attentive and patient. They came over to ask us how things were after we had gotten our meal. And before that when we were ordering we kept screwing up and changing our order and the young man behind the counter was incredibly patient and understanding about it. I got a ""build my own"" hot dog with relish, ketchup, and grilled onions. My husband got the Carolina. We both got combos. I've seen some people complain about the price, but I have no idea how you could complain about getting fries with any topping, a loaded hotdog, and a bottled artisan soda for 8. No, it might not be rock-bottom cheap, but it is definitely not overpriced. And the quality is excellent. As for the hotdogs themselves, I absolutely loved mine. Thick, flavorful, juicy. Nicely cooked. The bun was moist and fresh. The grilled onions were fresh and delicious. And the relish appeared to have been homemade. It was excellent. My husband also really liked his hotdog. The fries were fine. They weren't the best in town as claimed. But it's more of a preference thing. These were crusty on the outside and had been fried for a little longer than I might've liked. But it was clearly intentional--just a style that some people really like. They had lots of flavor. I just prefer fries that don't have that thick crispy exterior. It tends to retain grease. Of course, that didn't stop my husband or me from eating most of our fries. We finished the meal with some soft serve ice cream cones. The ice cream was good, much better quality then a lot, but certainly not the best I've had. But definitely up there. The small was very generously sized. And once again, the staff were quick and attentive. I would absolutely go back here, and I would recommend it for any hot dog connoisseurs or anyone who wants a fun casual spot with a great retro vibe. The decor was really quite fun. Even though it was raining, we went outside after afterward to enjoy the epic view of the Allegheny River, and the dam. A very nice spot indeed.",0,0,1,False,7,488,0.12941678203918736

We arrived at opening and were the first or second customers of the day, so there was no waiting. If you are trying to get brunch on the strip, that alone is a nice bonus. Food arrived in a reasonable time.

I had the Fried Chicken Biscuit.  It was served on a flaky biscuit, with white Southern-style gravy, two eggs over medium, and spicy (not too spicy) fried chicken with a thick and crunchy cereal-style crust.  Fist impressions and overall memory of the dish was that it was delicious. Not a bad bite in there, really.  Only two minor complaints about the dish. First would be that I would have liked a bit more black pepper in the gravy, and at a bit coarser grain. The chicken had a tiny kick to it, but not enough that the gravy didn't need that little extra spice I'm accustomed to. Living in the South may have also influenced my opinion on my other piece of feedback, which is that I would really have preferred a southern-style biscuit. The one they served tasted great, but the gravy in my mind calls for a biscuit that crumbles and flakes in a certain way.  Eggs were cooked just the way I like them without my having to ask, a slight runnyness in the yolks. Priced at $17, it's what you should expect for Smallman, and portions were above average for there.

Considering everything, very good dish. Recommended.",1,1,1,True,18,275,0.0994367563386796

Within a few days, he had put together a dinner menu- while keeping my budget in mind. He even went as far as to print out personalized menus wishing my boyfriend a happy birthday and reserving a table of our choice. He personally came out and served us each of the five courses and explained in detail what ingredients were used, where they were sourced from, and how the dish was crafted. His attention to detail in presentation (on and off of the plate) was magnificent. When the 5th course came out, the desert had special writing on it (see photos) as requested. Chef Ryan even went the extra mile and gave us each a free macaron... and then included three more in a small sample box for us to take home along with our leftovers.

Smallman Galley is a very cool concept which allows chefs to explore and become a launching pad for their career.  It is a smaller food hall with only 4 restaurants and a bar but it still gives you a lot of variety to try.  In general, the food hall has that cool industrial vibe and it is run similar to a cafeteria where you order at the counter of each restaurant and then you find a seat.  We came twice here and I will say it gets VERY busy during dinner and good luck getting a table.  It can be quite hard.

Brunoise is quite different from it's environment... it's fine dining ... in a food hall.  Different... absolutely.   After going to the Revival (Chicago), Torvehallerne (Copenhagen), and a bunch of other ones around the world, Brunoise does stand out as it gives refinement in an otherwise energetic, often hectic, and loud space.  The plating alone tells you that there's definitely attention to detail that you don't see in other food halls and it really does look quite stunning on the plate.  

I wish I could have said I bought my meal here but I didnt... I did buy dessert though and it made me realize that I should have bought my ENTIRE meal here to try.  It takes a lot of bravery (or craziness) to rethink a beloved childhood treat and reinvent it a bit to a refined dessert.  

S'mores - I remember it being a gooey sticky delicious mess of chocolate, caramelized sugar, vanilla, and graham.  I loved how the bruleed meringue captured that spirit while the chocolate is super creamy and a very rich mousse like texture... something akin to the melted chocolate except it doesnt burn your mouth.  And the fine crumbed graham sitting underneath some nice ice cream.  I have to admire his thoughts and definitely the amazing plating.  My only little comment would be about the ice cream ... I couldnt really discern much flavour other than it being sweet.

I was so excited to give The Pizza Shack a try when my schedule finally fit its hours. The ""HYPE"" is artificially created by the times at which the shop operates. Unfortunately the pizza could not back up the built up anticipation.

The only square cuts come in a large, so that is what I ordered because everybody said how great a square pizza it is!

It looked awesome! It smelled awesome! It tasted.....well, O.K. 

It was saucey. They were definitely going for a sweet sauce and they got it! But it wasn't exceptional.
What saddens me the most was that the cheese did not have me coming back for more; it was basic to say the least.

I would say the outside pieces were the best, because they were the most done? The dough supporting the inside pieces was not fully cooked (which is a no no in my book)!

The full piece of basil I found in a piece did not help The Pizza Shacks case either. 

In an area where square pizza is monopolized by Beto's, The Pizza Shack is bringing a very average tasting pie to the paddle that could maybe see another minute in the oven as well as some parmesan on top with some garlic coupled with oregano. It would surprise me if they last another handful of years in this location with their very weird hours. This is not a plug for Beto's but when The Pizza Shack does go out of business maybe Beto's could use this as a flag ship station and serve more of the South Hills?",0,0,0,False,27,298,0.11285935005283655

The crust is very buttery, almost like a pie crust. The sauce is sweet. In fact, it's very sweet. If you're familiar with the sauce at Fiori's, the sauce here is even sweeter than theirs. 

I really enjoyed my first few bites and definitely thought to myself that I could really enjoy this pizza.

Pizza Shack's pizza will ultimately either attract or repel you with a sweetness that flutters between felicity and vulgarity. I am drawn to it without being completely smitten.

I called the phone number listed on their website and scheduled three appointments for my three daughters.  The first one was at 8am.  I get to the office and we are taken back to an exam room.  It is then that I am told that these appointments are for exams only and not for cleanings, like I had asked for on the phone.  Also I am told that the dentist won't be in until 9am.  I was also told that they were booked out several months for cleanings, so I would have to wait months to actually get those cleanings I thought we were getting today!
So basically our visit was a complete waste of our time.  Who goes to the dentist for an exam and not a cleaning unless they are having problems of some sort??  Also, I made this appointment a month ago, so it's not like I just walked in off the street.  I also got several reminder emails about the appointments, all of which confirmed that we had an 8am appointment.
The woman who took us back to the room was completely indifferent.  She kept blaming the ""call center"" and said she could try to see if any of the dental hygienists could fit us in.  When she came back half an hour later I asked if she had been able to work us in but she said she hadn't asked the hygienists yet.  I asked if she would please do that.  Her attitude was unapologetic and unhelpful and I doubt she even asked the hygienists at all.  Of course, the answer was that no they could not fit us in.  Big surprise.  I was extremely annoyed as I had taken time off of work to bring my kids in.  The dentist was equally indifferent and just said ""What do you want me to do?  I don't have anything to do with scheduling.""  I get that, but everyone made me feel like I was being unreasonable and rude for being annoyed.  Not one person acted apologetic or even pretended to try to rectify the situation which would have gone a long way in making me feel better about what had happened.  I've worked in customer service my whole life and all they had to do was say ""I'm so sorry this happened. You must be so frustrated.  Here is how we can try to fix it .....""  They all kept explaining the logistics of the call center and their scheduling system, and why they aren't reliable.  As if a customer would have any knowledge of any of that!  As if I should have been prepared to waste my time today and not get the services I had scheduled because well, you know, that ""call center"" isn't accurate.  All I did was call the number they list on their website!
For all I know their dentist is fabulous as are all of their hygienists.  But based on this experience I will not be back.  So be warned everyone.  If you call their phone number, your call may be answered by a call center, which will schedule you for an ""appointment"" which doesn't actually include a cleaning, just a dentist looking in your mouth and saying ""brush better"" and that appointment with the dentist might not actually be when the dentist is even in, so you may have to wait an hour and fifteen minutes for him to look in your mouth and tell you to brush better.",0,0,0,False,8,582,0.12831156355943116

They will do extra things to your teeth without asking you or mentioning that they cost extra and then expect you to cough up the money before you leave. The hygienists are patronizing and the most recent time I went no dentist even looked at my teeth! This is no longer the reliable friendly office it used to be,3,0,0,False,7,101,0.14081918498709647

I had a few bad experiences with this guy in the past, ranging from his incredibly shaky hands, to his attempting to sell me something almost every time I go.  However, my most recent visit was so bad that I would never go to his office again.  Let me preface this by saying it takes a lot for me to complain about a dentist, as I am not someone with a perfect set of pearly white teeth.  But this guy is the worst and should not be allowed to practice.

I recently had bonding come off my front right tooth which I chipped over 10 years ago.  The initial chip was about 1/3 of the tooth.  Since I first chipped the tooth I believe the bonding has come off 2 or 3 times.  Each time this would happen, I would go to my previous dentist and he fixed it good as new.  

This concept seemed to be completely lost on Dr. Smiga.  I am not sure if he is so old that he is out of touch with proper procedures, if he was trying to get more money, or if he is just ignorant to his practice.  However, Dr. Smiga insisted that I needed a crown.  While I had my mouth full of cotton and other devices, a clipboard was placed on my chest.  I was told to review and sign the agreement for the $260 procedure.  I repeatedly asked why this was necessary as I had never been told or recommended this by a prior dentist.  I wanted to know why he could not simply repair it the way my prior dentists had.  Dr. Smiga also told me that the repair could not be done on the same day and that I would have to wait weeks.  This also made no sense to me because when I called I explained this was an emergency and I needed a normal looking tooth before the end of the week.  

Rather than politely explaining his position to me, Dr. Smiga became visibly agitated that I was not willing to blindly follow his recommendation.  He repeatedly told me that I was not doing things the right and proper way, in a very negative and aggressive tone.  I tried explaining to him that I needed something by the end of the week, but he just could not understand this.  

Eventually I convinced him to just go the bonding route.  He took about 15 minutes to do the bonding.  The end result of this was absolutely absurd.  It is amazing to me that any human, much less one with dental training would have sent me home with a tooth looking the way mine did.  I am convinced a person with no dental training could have done a better job.  What I ended up with was a front tooth with bonding that looked in no way similar to what a tooth should look like.  It was misshaped, out of position, and the complete wrong shade.  He did not even attempt to use the proper shade of tooth, which meant I ended up with half of my front right tooth pearly white, while the rest of my teeth were a darker shade.  He attempted to make it darker by buffing the tooth, but gave up soon after.  His final words to me when I remarked about how awful it looked were, ""No one is going to look at your tooth that closely"".  I was dumbfounded.  I wish I would have taken photos of the tooth, but it was so ridiculous to look at that I did not want to be reminded.  

On top of his horrendous job, his attitude was even worse.  He eventually left the room without a word, groaning and moaning about how I needed to do things the right way.  The bonding procedure was also pretty painful.  It is my opinion that he either intentionally screwed up because he was upset I would not agree to do things his way, or he is just clueless.  Either way it is unacceptable for a professional.

After leaving his office, and being horrified every time I looked in the mirror, I called my former dentist.  He got me in the very next day.  Not once did my old dentist mention anything about needing a crown.  Instead, he simply did the bonding procedure that was done on prior occasions.  It took him about 45 minutes to do the entire procedure because he actually took his time to do it correctly.  He carefully went through what shade I thought would be best to match my other teeth.  He grinded and crafted the tooth to be the perfect shape and fit.  When done the tooth looked completely normal.  Thankfully there are dentists that do things the right way, otherwise I would have looked like a clown all weekend.    

I will never return to Dr. Smiga's office and I do not think he should have a license to practice dentistry.",5,1,0,True,6,835,0.1596448546635977

She also advised me to park around the back, and cautioned me that the entrance and exit to the back of the building, were both one way. 
When I arrived, I checked in and began filling out all the new patient paperwork in a small, but comfortable waiting room.  With as filled up as the schedule was, I was taken to a room suprisingly quick.  Dr. Smiga stopped in my room within 5 minutes and chatted me up a bit to find out what was wrong.  He is an extremly friendly and such a nice guy.  He was very concerned with my pain and assured me that he would take care of it quickly.  I had a bitewing xray and within two minutes he was back in the room to perform a root canal.  He numbed me up quite well, unfortunately,  due to the infection it didn't _ completely numb me up, so when he drilled the back of my tooth, I almost jumped out of the chair.  He assured me that in three seconds, I would be pain free.   I was.   I could have kissed him.  I had been in pain for a week.  My entire new patient appointment, including  a root canal took only an hour.  Dr. Smiga and his staff are all very nice and friendly.   He is obviously an expert in his field.

Upon entering I was warmly greeted and given a menu which I would assume would be available for take out. With a Yelp check in you are entitled to a free cookie-chocolate chip or oatmeal raisin. He told me that their soup of the day was tomato which he said was excellent. I opted for one of their daily specials - chicken DeVinci on a hoagie roll. It comes with cheese, mushrooms, peppers and a tangy sauce. Since the sauce was a little to hot for me they substituted a marinara sauce in its place. He then told me that if I wanted to make it a combo I would get a fountain drink and a choice of either French fries or potato chips for just $2.00 more! I was amazed at the fact that most of their selections are under $10.00 just to start with! He also told me that breakfast items were available all day if I so chose.

After placing my order he gave me my chocolate chip cookie and took my name so they would bring it out to me. This place is small but it fills up fast over the lunch hour. I got my sandwich and fries in about 10 minutes and believe me it was so good, I was blown away! The fries were also delicious and even though I knew this was a probably a standard cookie I was amazed at how fresh it tasted! 

Basically all you have at your table are napkin dispensers. You get your condiments and utensils over at the fountain area. There is a separate area if you wish to purchase coffee. 

Among their offerings are various salads, hamburgers, hoagies, paninis, and wraps.  They have a listing for snacks and sides which include queso fritters, white cheddar macaroni and cheese, grilled cheese, hot dog or a cup of soup.

But we decided to try it out and form our own opinion. I am sure glad we did. Karl and Jeff were excellent. They were always on hand for any questions we had. Upon our arrival which was pretty late in the evening we met Karl. What a nice guy! He showed us to our room which was on the third floor. We had the Master suite. It was comfortable and spacious. We asked him about getting around and he gave us all kinds of great tips, like the T rail, and where to take it to and the prices of transportation and most importantly the neighborhood pub. 
I cant Imagine either Jeff or Karl going ""off"" like the other reviewer said, so my opinion is as follows. I liked staying here, the guys were very nice and efficient, helpful and always around. They have done a wonderful job restoring this place. Its conveniently located close to all points of interest. We parked our car on Wednesday night and did not move it till we were ready to leave. Karl took the time to point out on the map exactly where everything was and believe me we used that map. I couldn't get better directions from google maps! I highly recommend this Inn. Its close enough to everything we wanted yet far enough to be able to relax and have peace and quiet. As for the bad review, I think she may have been the problem. Some people no matter what you do just have to complain about something. If Karl did get to the point where he was screaming and yelling it probably was more due to this Msornageblossom being an inconsolable obnoxious person. These two owners had to be the gentlest human beings on earth. Had I been there I probably would have slammed doors myself.

The Inn has a very grand appearance on the outside, which continues on the inside. While not in pristine condition, the inside is certainly not shabby, and is clean. My bed was very comfortable. 

I met only one of the two innkeepers (sorry, I don't recall his name), but he was very nice and helpful. 

I wouldn't say the neighborhood is packed with restaurants and bars, but there are several (good ones!) within a three to four block walk. There's also a nice park immediate across the street from the Inn.

We WERE told, repeatedly, that the connection in our assigned room always worked, and that we were free to try other rooms.  It didn't work at all, anywhere in the Inn, the 2nd night.  (2) We were never offered assistance in finding another hotel in the area.  When we left the Inn, we had to go to McDonald's to get an internet connection in order to research other hotel possibilities for the 3 nights we were displaced. (3) The second night, we were the ONLY guests in the Inn, so there was no one else there to be ""understanding.""  We were only informed about the death in Karl's family as he was demanding that we leave while screaming at us about being ""privileged"" and from California.   (4) We were charged $111.66 too much up front for the 5 nights when we arrived for our stay at the Inn.  To date, we are still waiting for that amount to be refunded.  It is certainly NOT TRUE that we received a refund for the nights we stayed, although we feel that kind of refund would be entirely appropriate considering the harsh treatment and lack of services.  We are sorry that the innkeepers see this as ""an inconvenience.""  We see it as a very ugly and disturbing incident that ruined many hours of our time and cast a pall over the rest of our vacation.",5,1,0,False,10,270,0.10330653426182144

We could have lived with the cold cookies, popcorn and cheap candies put out for snack; or even, the lack of basic room service. Perhaps we should have felt ""warned"" the first evening when we were escorted to our room and told that we could put out the ""Maid, please service the room"" sign, but that we shouldn't count on anything happening.  Perhaps we should have been ""warned"" when the innkeeper manically scribbled all over a map while ""explaining"" what to see and how to get around in that neighborhood.  No doubt, we should have been more alert to what we were being charged up front for our 5 night reservation, because the innkeeper wildly disclaimed ability to use a calculator and insisted on doing the sums by hand with a pencil and paper.  As a result, we were immediately overcharged by $111.66  from the amount we had agreed to in writing several months before.  All of this was not what we expected, and as trusting ""guests"" who wanted to have an enjoyable time, we ignored the ""issues"" and let the eccentricities slide that first night.
  
As others have written in their reviews, the breakfast is a self-serve affair which was your basic budget hotel big-box store fare, with the exception of some yogurt, hard-boiled eggs and a bowl of aging frozen mixed fruit.  All of this was counter indicated by anything we've experienced in Bed and Breakfast establishments in the past, but we were trying to have a good time and not make a fuss.  However, my husband and I both work from our computers when we are traveling, and I had specifically asked well in advance about wifi and internet connection before I made our reservation to stay for 5 nights at the Inn.  I had been assured that there was wifi and that it was free of charge. It says this in all the online ads for the hotel as well. Needless to say, we were taken aback the first night of our stay when it took us a long time to connect to the internet, and only when we figured out that we had to use a very old connection protocol.  When consulted, the innkeeper claimed he personally didn't have much use for the internet and was fairly indifferent to our requests for a decent internet connection.  On the second night, when we returned to our unserviced room, we discovered that there was no internet connection at all.  I went in search of Karl, the innkeeper, to help us, but he was nowhere to be found.  After struggling with the problem for quite a while, we gave up on trying to get any business done via internet.

 The next morning, while I was fetching our coffee and pastries from the breakfast area, Karl appeared.  I very politely told him the situation with the internet and asked if he would call the internet service provider to find out why there was no internet service to the house.  At first, Karl simply seemed indifferent and told me that our room could always get internet.  About two minutes later, out of the clear blue, he was screaming at me from the stair landing that I ""didn't know what it's like to work for a living because you've led a privileged life, could do anything you want, and had never worked a day in your life.""  I stood in shock with the creamer in my hand over the Folgers!  Never in my life have I encountered such outrageous, presumptive insults; and certainly not from the host of a hotel to whom I'd paid good money to provide reasonable services and a comfortable time.  My husband witnessed this scene from the top of the stairs.  When I returned, quit shaken, to our room, we discussed the situation and agreed that we should leave.  After packing our traveling gear, my husband went in search of the innkeeper to explain that we would be leaving due to his intolerable behavior, and to request a refund for the three nights remaining.  After several minutes of calling all over the house for him, Karl finally crept out of a downstairs door.  My husband made his requests, and within seconds we both witnessed him fly into an insane rage once again, screaming nonsense which included insults of both of us and our home state, slamming doors multiple times, and then reopening the doors in order to follow us around while screaming at us to get out.  He only barely managed to come up with a refund slip, although it was for the wrong amount and was not processed correctly because of the faulty internet connection and because of his unwillingness to use a calculator for doing sums.  This whole scene and situation wasted many hours of a day of our long-anticipated vacation in Pittsburgh, but we were both happy to get away from so much insult and outrage.  We certainly would never recommend that anyone stay at the Inn on the Mexican War Streets.",4,5,0,False,9,856,0.09010526121168744

says online that they have a student discount, and he gave me no student discount even after i asked. and it was still $45. once again, ""oh well whatever, i guess ill just deal with it""

CCAC has made some mistakes... My online application for admission did not appear to submit, so I filled out and mailed in a hard-copy application just in case. My adviser made a mistake with writing me up for two labs for a science class rather than just one lab, but the woman who registered me into the computer noticed the error and fixed it. The registration, payment, etc. offices could have more signs so that students know where to walk and stand. The IT department made a mistake with students' usernames and their programming so that I was unable to log in to the library's website from home, but after several emails to several employees, they finally figured out the problem and fixed it. Maybe the professors could use textbooks that are used by universities rather than textbooks that are written by community college instructors. I have noticed some errors in the text!

I came to BJ's for a manicure with a friend a few months ago and am sad to say that I will never be back.

The nail salon itself was clean and well-kept, but the customer service I experienced was truly appalling. When we arrived, my manicurist told my friend and I to pick out our nail polish colors and take a seat at our stations. As soon as I carried mine over to my table, the manicurist accidentally dropped an open bottle of polish that he was working with onto the floor next to my feet, causing the nail polish to spray all over my shoes and pants.

Now, let me be perfectly clear with you guys. Accidents happen, and while I was shocked and in a minor state of panic, I tried to keep my cool. I happened to be wearing a more expensive pair of shoes that day since I was out with one of my girlfriends - they were worth about $75. I tell you this only because I think this fact contributed even further to my dismay at what happened next. I expected the manicurist to immediately apologize and make some offer of reciprocation in order to remedy the situation. Instead, without saying anything at all, he quickly poured some acetone onto a large rag, bent down, and started vigorously rubbing my shoes with the acetone. I backed away quickly in complete shock, as he was spreading the polish and making it worse. After that, instead of showing remorse or asking if the salon could repay me for the shoes, he kept insisting, ""Accidents happen, it wasn't my fault. Please, accidents happen!"" over and over again. Yes, accidents do happen, I agree. But as an employee of an upstanding business, I would expect much better treatment toward a paying customer. 

My friend and I asked to speak to a manager at that point, who continued to assure us that accidents happen and offered no help at all to fix the situation. I thought at the very least they could offer to give me my manicure for free, but they did not even do that. Neither the manicurist who made the mistake nor the manager of the salon offered me one thing in return for the accident that had occurred and ruined my shoes and pants. My girlfriend and I left the salon in complete disgust. This may not be the experience that you've personally had at BJ's salon, and honestly, I hope it isn't.

Sooo I figured I was taking chances.  Glad I did!!

Made an appointment with Kenny and I got there and he took me right away. I explained that the person who had previously done (just 7 days prior) my nails did a good job, but after a week they were already looking old and uneven and cruddy.  I have an event tonight so I wanted them to look clean and fresh.

Kenny reshaped and filled my nails and made them exactly how I asked.  He checked in with me quite a few times to see whether the shape was OK or if he was hurting me.  I really appreciated that and didn't feel uncomfortable letting him know exactly what I wanted.  It shows he really cares about his quality of work and his customers by checking in and not being rude when you ask for something..............after all, this is a service for YOU that YOU are paying for!

He was also extremely careful and neat while painting my nails. I chose a nude color and then he put a topcoat on that dried in a UV machine...and I was on my way!

Things he did that most salons don't:
checked in with me at every step, made sure my cuticles were all perfectly clean, round and matching, made sure my nail shape was exactly how I wanted, double checked his work and made improvements until he was satisfied, took the time to look at them to make sure they were all even, painted slowly and neatly.

1. Since my visit I researched and had learned that a lot of salons will not charge you for a full set of acrylics and then a full set of gels on top. If the client is doing a full set of acrylics, and then wants gels they normally cut the price in half for the gel polish to be on top. So I think charging me $55 for a manicure was a total rip off. 
2. My gel polish w/ the acrylics lasted 11 days. NOT worth it. It was because she applied the gel too thickly that it settled and pooled down by my cuticles. It was the first area to lift around day 8 to where I couldn't even run my fingers through my hair without getting hair caught under the nail. 
3. My pedicure chipped in under a week. I never had this happen before. I can paint my own toes and have it last a month with no chip. I'm going to blame this on not capping the tips of the nails.

However, I was in last week and had a horrible experience. I went in for a mani and pedi at my scheduled appt time. Kris was my manicurist for my visit. Pedicure went fine. However the tips weren't capped offs with the polish, but oh well. The real trouble started with the mani. We started with what I originally wanted as a gel mani. I told her last time I was there that my gel mani only lasted 7 days. Gels and shellac are supposed to be much longer. She suggested that she wanted to help me out and put a acrylic down over my natural nail. I told her if she really thought it would help then okay but I wanted the acrylic thin and natural looking. She didn't explain to me how that would be priced since I wasn't getting tips or anything. 
So I let her start and she doesn't clip hang nails or cuticles. Lightly used a dremel which was fine with me. Then a client came in asking for a fill and so she called her to a table like 3 tables behind me and left me there and started on the other girl's nails. Then came back to me. Applied the acrylic (very thickly) then had me cure in the UV light for 10 mins (uhh what?). Then she left while I was curing and did the other girls nails. She was leaving me 10-20mims at a time and did it about six times. She took like 2 other walk-ins and worked on them while also working on me. With all the time I was sitting there I thought 'regular polish is going to last long on acrylics... I don't really want to pay for the gels if they are gonna charge me a full set for that too.' 
But... After being in that nail salon for TWO HOURS I basically paid for the damn gels on top of the acrylic so I could get the hell out of there and not have to sit there any longer waiting for a regular polish to dry. 
It was a really stressful visit that was supposed to be relaxing. I was trying to treat myself and left more stressed. They most certainly charged me for a full set of acrylics even thought I didn't do tips. With the gels and a pedicure. The price was $75 and two miserable hours later with nails that are way too thick for my liking (and yes I asked them to be thinned during the process...)
Seriously very sweet owners, but I had an appointment and walk-ins should have been taken after me being finished. Not passed around. Her trying to juggle only ticked me off and it shows in her work where the polish was pooled on to my cuticles, hang nails weren't clipped, under natural nail wasn't cleaned, no hand massage or lotion, and the tips weren't capped. I question cleanliness when you have clients bumping from table to table and the manicurist going from client to client. I should have taken a que when there was clipped nails all over the station I first sat at. 
My very last thing, that is minor... I don't want to watch the news and learn about the terrible things going on when I'm trying to be at peace and relax.

Always a risk going to a new place. Read this review by Shari G. And decided to go see Kenny. By the way I have to admit that this is the first time that I got my nails done by a guy. So I arrived to get a regular fill for my acrylics, and let me just say that he did the best job ever!!!
He got how I wanted them without me explaining, I wear them round and thin as possible and I like it to look as natural as I can. Not only he did that but he also fixed a little bit of the previous work. Looks so good!

And the place is clean and neat, prices are right, I came to my appointment on time and didn't have to wait a second. So recommended!

The lady kept pushing me to get my eyebrows waxed, which I refused so she just stopped talking. My friends pedicure was not started by another technician until my nails were bring painted, and they had to give her new water because it was cold.

Let me start by saying I am super picky about my nails. Oh, so very picky. I am a crazy busy small business owner, so I don't have time to mess around with my nails all the time, but they HAVE to look good. I'm a hairstylist/hair colorist, so polish doesn't last, and gel gets stained super fast; I wear acrylic ""pink & whites"" with a buff finish because they hold up the best for me. It drives me nuts when the nails are too thick like little baseball bats, or too long, or when the white is too wide. I like thin, natural looking nails with the white edge positioned where my natural free edge would be, not halfway up my nail. AND- No, I do NOT want a gel finish to make them shiny, thank you very much. Gel stains and it drives me BONKERS when I have to explain that more than once to a nail tech who wants to save a little time or upsell me. I want them buffed, and i don't want to have to argue about it. 

So.... that said, let me repeat:
This is, by far, my favorite nail salon in Pittsburgh. They're conveniently located on the southbound side of McKnight Rd, not far from Ross Park Mall. (right next to Midas and close to Bed Bath and Beyond) The salon is clean, they use top quality products and the work is stellar. My nails are ALWAYS perfect- thin, just the right amount of white tip, the pink is exactly the right color, and I don't even have to ask for the buff finish any more, he just does it for me. They do lots of other, fancier stuff there too, if you want it. Nail designs, mani-pedis, etc. I never have time for it. It's all I can do to get there every few weeks for a fill. That's my only complaint, and it's more about me/my life than the salon; often I just don't have time to get there. My business is in a different part of town and I can't always get away for appointments. But, every time I've just ducked in some random shop that happens to be closer, hoping to just get a simple fill, it's never... EVER.... as good as the work I get at BJ Nails. My stepdaughter and her friends and various family members also come here, and be warned, they do get busy. But they are well worth the wait.",6,0,1,False,3,427,0.016351893276832404

Take the advice and check out other gyms before going here - 

I absolutely loved this gym until they decided to gauge my bank account without authorization.
Used this location since 2014 - trained for my first marathon, facilities were ok with the exception of your favorite machines being broken for long periods of time. I really liked working out in the cinema room though.

so here's your one star workout:
They don't value the fact that you've been loyal customer for three years - instead...

The manager Jesse Frazier was also the worst human being (I'm noticing all management seems to be pretty rotten based on others current reviews and my previous review in 2014 - which coincidentally also had to do with billing!).  Jesse the ""manager"" had 0 compassion to the fact that I'm now 8 months pregnant, haven't been using my membership since the beginning of the year for medical reasons in this pregnancy & was still paying for it well into my second trimester (which I didn't complain about that part at all, I sucked it up), and yet he couldn't get why I was upset for the obvious reason - that even though my account was on a ""freeze"" (and I did have good intentions of returning after my pregnancy) due to my inability to use the gym, I STILL got gauged with a $40 annual fee - which I was NEVER told about from day 1 & also pretty ticked that I found this out about this just now, that they've been doing this fee charge from my bank for three years without ever telling me it was even a thing - FYI, $40 yearly fee = three months at ANOTHER GYM! My bad for not noticing the past few years, otherwise I would have been out of here sooner. 

Also, *you'll never get an invoice or a bill from this gym - once they authorize your account you're basically free game to them to charge whatever they want, whenever they want. And to make matters worse, you'll get to deal with ""abc financial"" a third party company that loves to take your money on behalf of Golds Gym, but will find a way to pass you from supervisor to supervisor to telling you to talk to Golds Gym about your billing to passing you onto voicemail until you give up trying.  ABC will tell you to go into the gym, the gym will say talk to ABC billing.
ARE YOU EXHAUSTED YET?  The billing is a workout!!  
Then the only way to get them to stop stealing your money is to call your bank and put it in as fraud - **Which is actually easier to work with your bank than working with golds gym!!**

Also, When I asked Jesse if he had a manager he said no, supposedly he's the top dog running that gym, which is hard to believe considering his customer service skills & looking at these reviews there does seem to be other managers - Tyler perhaps?  Pretty sure he was lying to me because he knew I would report him for being an asshole to me.

OH it keeps going!

So not only was Jesse Frazier unwilling to help on the $40 fee reversal, he also informed me that there's a FEE TO CLOSE THE ACCOUNT!  WOW, no one ever told me about that either when opening the account, and again, if they had, I never would have gone here knowing all these fees were going to be included in my membership.  That's how they get you!

Jesse's rebuttal ""well you should have read your contract""  ok big shot.  good one. I'm sure you read all your contracts too, riiiiight.  that's why you have REPS WORKING THERE getting people to sign these contracts - to tell customers about these charges - not at this gym, they are there to tell you what you want to hear to rush you into signing a contract and avoiding telling you about the fees because they know it's insane & they wouldn't have anyone signing up if they did.  That's called fraudulent sales work ethic in my book.

Even though the account was ""frozen"" months ago - what I should have done was simply closed the account in then & none of this would have happened.  It was my bad for being a loyal customer and thinking that when they said ""freeze"" they meant ""freeze"" - that term doesn't mean anything, it's not a thing. They say that to keep you as a customer.

I ended up calling them out on credit card fraud with my bank.  
This corporate franchise is the worst, choose somewhere else if you're looking for stress free contracts and interactions.  Look up their corporate headquarters star ratings too, it's worse than the local.

go to the local website & click on ""Gym Staff"" - there's a reason that pages doesn't exist, because they don't want their names known because they are all crooks.

If you like getting into hidden fees that no one at this location is willing to tell you about, this is the gym for you. If you like having to close your credit card so that they can't tap into your account while you're on leave from the gym for medical reasons, this gym is for you. If you like crappy customer service if you EVER get into issues, this gym is for you!

Enjoy your workout.",6,0,0,False,42,927,0.11846843421686028

I too had to cancel my credit card and have a new one issued in order to stop being charged for the monthly membership. The management and staff, or lack thereof, is completely incompetent and inept at their jobs. My niece was visiting for 3 months from Brasil and since it was winter we signed her up for a gym membership to give her something to do during the day while we were at work. This was all explained to Larry, the Golds rep that signed us up and he said that they could do a temporary membership for her until she left at the end of April. He said all we had to do after she left was to let them know and they would cancel the automatic monthly charge. My niece took some classes and enjoyed being able to get out and have something to do but I noticed she always showered when she got back to the house and said it was because the locker room and showers were so disgusting and dirty that she would rather wait until she came home. My niece flew home to Rio and I called to let Golds know to cancel the membership and was told Larry was no longer working there. (SHOCKER) The girl on the phone also rudely and condescendingly berated me for thinking that I could just cancel the membership like that and that they do not do that. She told me that there is a process for canceling a membership. I told her that I understood what she was telling me but that was not the arrangement that was made when we signed up and that the entire situation was explained to the sales person before we signed up for anything. She then told me that the only person that could do anything to help me was the manager, Tyler Dzadovsky who was conveniently not in. It was 3 PM and I asked if he would be back in later and she said yes and took my name and number and promised he would call me back that day. Obviously, he didn't. So I called him the next morning at 8 and was told by the guy that answered that ""Yeah, well Tyler doesn't usually come in until like 10, 10:30 or 11"". Again left name, number and message. Again no call back. I called the gym sometimes twice a day and at least 4 days every week and went through this for the month of May. Apparently Tyler's managerial hours are somewhere between 11 and 3 (tell me where I can sign up for that) I finally called my bank and reported them and the bank said all I could do was to report my card lost or stolen and wait 7 to 10 business days for the new one to arrive.

The manager actually yelled at me over the phone when I called to cancel my membership. I have been a member for 8 days and have realized that I do not need this membership.

Because they are franchise-owned and don't have to report to shareholders, the General Manager Tyler Dzadovsky was completely unhelpful and unprofessional. Their attitude is basically, ""your problem!"" No where on the site during my sign up was it made CLEAR to me that this was a contractual agreement. If that were the case, I wouldn't have signed up in the first place.

Beyond that, I felt really pressured by their staff to sign up for a personal training program that also had ridiculous contract terms, (can't cancel it unless you're moving out-of-state, and even then there's a cancellation fee -- WHAT THE F*CK?) In what world does a customer not have control over what services, GYM INCLUDED, they choose to purchase and when? It's honestly baffling to me.

I've been a member since March of 2014. The first red flag was that my coupon was not honored as advertised. I got a flyer from Gold's with a coupon for $9.99/month special. I brought it with me and the staff told me that price was just for Thursday-Sunday of every month. Why wouldn't they disclose that? 

I ended up getting a decent deal and decided to join. A month into the membership, I noticed a promotion for ""Free boxing lessons to the first 50 people who sign up"" How exciting, right? I signed up and booked a session with a trainer. Turns out, it was a money making scheme and I did not learn anything about boxing. It was a free personal training session with a consultation afterwards. The session went well and the trainer even offered me a second free session! Turns out, he bailed without notice on that free session once he realized I was not in a financial position to sign up for personal training services. In regards to the aforementioned consultation; it was extremely uncomfortable. The trainer gave me a hard time about my budget and he asked inappropriate questions about my personal life. He didn't take any time to get to know my background in health & fitness or understand my goals with my gym membership. 

Since that experience, I have avoided the trainers and any promotions. I started taking Heather's cardio classes and they are AWESOME!!! That is the one redeeming quality and the reason I am still a member. Along with her classes, Gold's spruced up their class variety as a ""New Year, New You"" promotion. They added more spinning classes, Core work, and Insanity! Surprisingly, at no extra charge! 

A note on the gym amenities: Locker room is kept clean but a handful of the lockers are falling apart. The sauna is a great perk but always take a towel with you, I am skeptical of the cleanliness. The equipment is maintained based on popularity. Rowing machines & bikes are not first in line for repairs :( 

My advice: Avoid the promotions for ""Free training sessions,"" check out the class schedule & find your niche!",6,0,0,True,20,391,0.10682205433343739

The pros:
For all the classes they have, the price is ridiculously cheap. You are not going to find spin/boot camp/yoga/any of the other million classes that they have for cheaper than what you get them for here. It's really a bargain in that regard.

The teachers are all pretty nice. I've had teachers I've certainly liked more than others but all of them are trying hard and want you to have a good class. 

It's pretty convenient if you work downtown. Located close to a bunch of bus stops. Close enough to the trails for biking to. Have not tried to drive/park down there. Imagine it'd be a nightmare.

Seems like a lot of people say the men's locker room is gross. I find the women's locker room to be quite clean. It can get crowded around 5-ish but to be expected. I've taken a shower there and thought the showers were clean and had great water pressure.

They let you suspend your membership for up to 6 months. I never go to the gym in the spring/summer/early fall so this worked great for me. They were super nice to me about it.

I find the staff to all be really, really nice. Like so nice. They always shout ""Have a great night!"" when you leave. They're just nice people. 

Unlike other commenters I've had no problem with their billing system. It's always what they tell me it's going to be and they told me upfront about an annual renewal fee which I was charged. No surprises for me. Sorry others have had that experience. 

The drawbacks:
The class schedules change often based on attendance. Starting in January they had a 5:30 spin class Monday through Thursday at 5:30. As of Feb 1, that has changed to only Tuesday and Wednesday. This is slightly annoying because I went to cancel my membership in December citing the fact that they had cancelled almost all of the 5:30 spin classes. They convinced me to stay by telling me they were adding all the classes back. Which, to be fair, they did...for a month. The classes weren't really well attended and I get why they cut them but still its hard not to be mildly irked. But you can still get in the spin room when there aren't any classes so I just DIY a spin classes which is fine. Plus you're off in this room by yourself, it's like have a private gym! And, when I tried to cancel my membership they lowered my monthly fee significantly. If you've been going there for over a year, tell them you want to leave, they will give you a better deal. 

The spin room had 5 new bikes and the rest are old. Riding the older bikes is positively miserable. But, since so few people go to spin classes it's not that hard to get a new bike. But having so few people results in classes getting cancelled. Chicken/egg situation, I suppose.

Oh and I guess it'd be nice if the gym was open until 9pm on the weekends. I'm forever frantically trying to get down there before 7 on Sunday to get an hour workout in. 

Anyways, yeah. I like Gold's. I'm sticking with it. I'd recommend it to a friend.",1,0,0,False,19,577,0.12391006057905161

The 6am classes are the best - worth every penny.
The cinema room is very cool.

Issue comes in their billing.  Golds gym on more than one occasion has decided to randomly take extra money out of my account without notifying me.  Once it was handled by the management in house, they were really nice & credited me the month after they decided that my membership was going to be $19.99 (which was not in my contract agreement).

This month, however, I spoke to Justine - who was a total jerk on the phone.  She said that they tried taking money out of my account on 4 different days in the month - which is exactly when I get paid, so I can't even explain why they said the account was declined.  
Either way, they decided to go ahead and charge me a late fee of MORE THAN DOUBLE my monthly membership dues. 
Not only that - they never called me, never emailed me, AND when I came into the gym and they swiped my card, NEVER told me there was a problem!!!

With attitude, Justine basically said 'there's nothing I can do, you have to call ABC'  some outside company that assesses the charges. So I get to wait on hold with them...

I constantly have to watch over this company and make sure that I'm being charged the correct amount every month.

It's clean, the staff are very friendly/helpful, & they offer a variety of amenities that are included with membership. Did I mention the membership is $19.99/month? So not bad at all for price compared to what all you get. 

I've noticed that there's never really a wait for any equipment ever & everybody seem to be pleasantly doing their excerises without any bothers from others... so that's really nice. ... no gym creepers.
 
I also am thrilled that they offer free tanning with membership. I'm getting married in 3 months & I'm not waiting to look like a ghost so this amenity makes me very happy. My only bummer with the tanning rooms as they are dusty & really really really warm when you go in. Really wish they'd put some AC on in those rooms or add another fan,  but other than that they do the job. 

I recently went down on 5-30-14 for a free nutrition & health assessment. The gentleman that talked with me was Scott & was really nice & knowledgeable. He explained everything well & was upfront. I agreed to a personal training program & didn't think as much on my month expenses/budget (wedding in 90 days ...paying cash for it...eek).Afterward, did some number crunching only to realize I bit off a Lil more than what I could chew. Reread my contract, saw that I could bow out. Called early today,  spoke to Scott again who was perfectly nice to me about it (canceling my training program membership)...I was concerned it wasn't going to go well as I've read some great but not great reviews. Scott really put my mind at ease & even asked if there was any other reason to cancel aside from what I told him. I felt that was really awesome of him to ask that & to care about what I said. Asked if my deposit would be refunded, was told in 3-5 business days & no other charges should come up. Gave them my written notice to terminate my program & I'll send a copy to their corporate office just to be sure/safe. 

All in all,  I'm pleased up to this point. I'm hopeful I'll have my deposit refunded in a timely manner & Scott was so nice about everything,  no pressure at all & just decent all around.

The smiley cookies alone are super nostalgic and remind me of all the times I came here with my family when I was a kid. I still love Eat'n Park just as much, and this location has treated me well each time I've visited it.

The salad bar at Eat'n Park has always been one of my favorites. They feature a rotating selection of soups, fruit, muffins, salad, etc. It won't break the bank, either, as my boyfriend and I each got an appetizer along with the salad bar for under $30. You can't beat it! The appetizer portions were big enough to be the perfect meal with a cup of soup and a salad. We went on a Sunday, and the soup of the day is potato soup, which is my absolute favorite soup here. They also have potato soup on Wednesdays, and on the Sunday we visited they also had classic chicken noodle. My boyfriend was kind of bummed they didn't have chili because that's his favorite, but maybe next time!

For our appetizers, we got the mac and cheese bites and fried zucchini. The portion of fried zucchini we got was enormous! It was more than enough for two people to share, and then some! The mac and cheese bites are a newer addition to the Eat'n Park menu, and they were also pretty good. Our waiter was quick to take our order and our food arrived right after we got our first go at the salad bar.

Overall, we had a great experience here. Everything tasted awesome, especially that famous potato soup! The service was fast and friendly, and we even decided to take an apple pie home to enjoy for dessert. Eat'n Park's slogan is ""The Place for Smiles,"" and our visit to the Robinson location definitely left us smiling!",1,1,3,True,37,320,0.09220727543585472

The Superburger is based off the Big Boy (Eat'n Park used to be affiliated with Frisch's Big Boy).  It is similar to a Big Mac, only the quality is 100 times better, it has two pickle chips on top, and instead of ""Special Sauce"" it has ""Sauce Supreme,"" which is a little bit different.  The fries were delicious, and the lemonade was good.  For dessert, I ordered the pie of the month, which was a Pumpkin Creme Pie.  It was delicious.

The hostess couldn't find a clean table at which to seat us. That should have been the first clue that we were in trouble.

I passed by the salad bar on my way to our table. They were out of just about everything.  Guess I won't order salad bar. Second clue.

The man at the table next to us was complaining to a manager about waiting. Third clue.

Add to this the fact that the kids at the booth behind us were screaming and telling their parents to shut up. Par for the course at an establishment of this caliber. 

It took 15 minutes for our waitress to even appear. 

We finally got our drinks after 29 minutes at the table. She brought a few of the accessories- cole slaw, some dinner rolls. She walked away with my iced tea though. And we still had no silverware.  That took another 10 minutes. 

40 minutes into my Eat n Park experience and the two tables on my right are still dirty, as is the floor. (See picture)

My son said his chocolate milkshake was pretty good despite the fact that they screwed up and brought it with whipped cream and a cherry after I specifically requested that they leave those off.  

43 minutes and counting. No food yet. Our server,  Lori, just explained something about putting a big tickets for another group through before ours. Whatever. Thanks for trying to make your problems mine.   

They just bussed and cleaned the 2 dirty tables next to me. Not the floor though. Used napkins and straw wrappers and fries and all.

48 minutes. No food. And we're all out of drinks. 

Food arrived after 50 minutes at the table. It was just ok. My Nantucket cod looked like it had been baking under the warmer for a while. (See picture) It was pretty tasty, I will admit. They forgot my mother's garlic bread. 

59 minutes in, the waitress reappeared with one drink refill but none for the rest of our table. We asked about the garlic bread. Hmm. She was surprised we didnt have it and blamed it on the kitchen (but they aren't the ones who bring out our meals....) 

1 HR and 13 minutes. The waitress brought our check and the missing garlic bread.  
I just realized that she never brought my son his french fries at all.

She was nice enough to bring my 2 kids free Smiley cookies even though they are too old for the kids menu. 

At the register,  I asked to speak to the manager.  He apologized up and down. I told him that this was the worst Eat n Park experience I've ever had. I'm not one to complain but I work in a service industry and this was just horrible on every account. He discounted our bill by half. Not completely acceptable but whatever. He tried to tell me that they never get this busy. I kindly explained that, since there was no line waiting to be seated like there is on weekends and this was not during the actual dinner rush (it's 8:10pm) I doubt that what he's saying is true and he needs to get a grip and have a serious conversation with his staff, especially Lori the air headed server.

They have their own free parking lot next to it.

I had previously arranged a tour which you must do so in advance. I did learn however, that if you happen to arrive at the time of a tour and they have space then they will accommodate you. The cost of your tour is $20.00 but for 2 hours it is worth every minute of it. When you arrive just ring the doorbell and they will let you in at the time of your tour. Both cash and cards are accepted.

Rick, our guide today, explained that this fire station closed on the exact date of Clemente's passing. However, the purpose of the museum is to showcase his life. The current owner Duane Rieder specializes in photography and has a tasting room next door as well as selling premium wine. In addition, there is a wine cellar in the basement along with a huge venue for entertaining. Some famous sports celebrities have been here in the past but the venue can be rented out for any occasion.

Unfortunately, on this visit I wasn't able to visit the cellar nor the the tasting room because they were making wine. Nevertheless, I came for the tour and believe me it did not disappoint. While I was growing I used to go with my dad to ball games and I remembered seeing Roberto at bat. He was an outstanding player.

I was blown away by the fact that this museum is not strictly devoted to Roberto himself but brings into play some of the other baseball notables of his day including Bill Mazerowski and Dick Grout to name a couple. Much of the collectibles were donated by his family but I saw a couple making a donation of their own.

Although you are not permitted to touch anything photography is highly recommended and using your cell phone is sufficient. Your tour starts in the old ""garage"" of the fire station where you can still see one of the poles used by the firemen of their day. There is a replica of the Forbes Field scoreboard on the famous world series day when Bill Mazerowski hit that 3 run homer to win the series against the NY Yankees.

Born in Puerto Rico, the custom is that a person's full name included the mother's maiden name at the end. His full name therefore was Roberto Clemente Walker. We got to learn a little about his military years and were free on own after the tour to take an in depth look at any of the memorabilia and ask questions. Relics, chairs, benches, and placards from both the old Forbes Field that sits now on the Oakland Pitt Campus and Three Rivers Stadium that was demolished to create Heinz Field are still there.

Perhaps one of the saddest relics was a small piece of the plane carrying Clemente on New Year's Eve when he made that charitable journey which resulted in his death. However, the photographs of not only him but other great notables of his day really blew me away. They also have a trading ""card"" collection carefully persevered which you would have found in  gum, cereal boxes or others things that were popular years ago. I loved the original bench signed by Bill Mazerowski and Dick Groat. There were also photos of his wedding day.

We also got to see his 1961 cleats and the 1971 World series home plate. the back room is called the Manny Sanguillen rooms but it holds trophies and collections dating back to other notable players such as Willie Stargell. Among which is his World series pennant trophy.

The 2nd floor is accessed by two staircases. The building has no elevators. Upstairs is where the firemen lived and where Duane Reider has his photography studio.  Among the things you will see here is 1971 collection of Pirate team bats, Clemente's 1961 Silver bat award, the last bat he ever used along with the last uniform worn, and some of the other teams star players of the day that proved a challenge for him.

I was extremely impressed with a nation's flag laid out that had sport's member's autographs on it in the main room. A sign next to it tells you the names. Throughout the entire tour the number 21 came into play whether it was measuring a ceiling beam or something else devoted to his life. Clemente's jersey number was 21.  I also learned he didn't like to be called ""Bob.""

There's so much more but at the end there is a small gift shop where you can buy Tees and books.Other items are available online including prints. I did ask about weekend tours for the working and yes they can be arranged. Contact Elizabeth Harrison either by phone or email.

The Clemente Museum is next door to Alida's Woodfire Cucina where you can stop for a bite. As I noted previously that restaurant owns the part of the private parking lot used by the museum. This museum is one of Pittsburgh's hidden gems and if you have a baseball lover in your house then this is the place to go.

Once I got past the temperature, the space was quite beautifully redone and fun to walk around.  However, I wouldn't call this space a museum really, as it feels more like a themed winery to me.

Unfortunately, I was not impressed with any of the wines that we sampled at this event, which I believe was three or four wines.  The bottles and labels were really cute, but the actual wine did nothing for me.  I couldn't make it past a sip or two of any of them.  Sorry!

Not opening the museum up to the community feels a bit elitist, which is odd considering who Roberto Clemente was.

I waited maybe 3 minutes after her answer.

The cashier told someone their order and I thought she was talking to me (because we again locked eyes). And she said, ""No. Not you."" I apologized and waited for my food. She was nice to the other customers from what I saw, so I didn't feel too good. I took my food and thanked them.

Our first impression was coming up to a broken sign advertising their current deal and whatever the bottom deal was, it was illegible.  Once we got up the counter we were met with the cashier and what I believe to be a manager bickering and scowling at each other while customers waited in line.  While placing my order the cashier mumbled, still don't know exactly what she was saying, so I made guesses and tried to place my order.  She also cut me off before completing my order so I had to finish after she already completed the transaction.  I ordered spicy chicken tenders, mac'n cheese, buffalo sauce, and a strawberry pie.  She informed me that the spicy chicken would take about 3 minutes to make.  

*15 minutes later*

My group is standing to the side while the line built up to about 10 people while the staff continued to bicker at each other.  Once they finally produce a bag of chicken, the cashier mumbled what it was so 3 people (me included) approached her.  Apparently we had all ordered spicy chicken.  At this point the manager comes over at get rather abrupt with the 3 customers.  The initial order did not fulfill anyone's order so the manager threw mac'n cheese in the bag to meet one customers order.  Then she handed me my bag, after a quick review I notice there was no pie or sauce.  By the time I turned around the 3rd customer was instructing the manager on what he had ordered, apparently she had misplaced the order slip.  So I try to get anyone's attention, eventually I was able to get the initial cashier's attention... to which she ran into the manager and grabbed me a pie off the shelf.  

At this point my group and I were tired of spending time in the midst of the chaos so going back for my sauce was a lost cause.  The biscuit was also stale, which is the reason we went there in the first place.

The worst part is how it was handled. I called the manager later to inform him of this and to avoid it happening to someone else. They told me it was ""impossible"" to be given undercooked chicken. I was appalled. I emailed corporate and had no response. Terrible.

In fact, the entire point is for it to prioritize speed and efficiency and economy with ""good enough"" food and service. If someone on either side of the counter starts holding up the line - which at this location during lunch rush can be grueling - that is what constitutes bad customer service. 

You go to a Popeye's, or any fast food chain for that matter, because you want the exact same food you had at any other location, you want it hot, and you want it quickly. That is the model which the entire fast food industry is based on. So, evaluating it by appropriate standards, and rating it for what it is; this Popeye's does a pretty good job. The chicken is freshly fried, the biscuits are soft and just a little crispy, the sides are all hot and taste reasonably fresh.

First off, the workers are extremely friendly and helpful.  I chatted with them the entire time they prepared my food.  They explained the different menu options and also how all of their food is fresh.  A lot of places have good service but the workers here really seemed to go above in making sure I was happy with my meal.  

Now to the food.  I ordered a single cheeseburger with lettuce tomato and onion.  I also had a side of fries.  The fries were the first thing I ate and they were great.  You can tell they are housecut fries and it really made the difference.  They went perfect with the malt vinegar hey have on the tables.  As for the burger, it was very good for the type it is.  Do not expect a burgatory type thick burger, it is more like five guys style.  You could tell it was fresh and tasted very good.  I also thought the bun style was a good choice for the type of burger.

As I said there are a couple things I think they could change.  One, they have packaged ranch dressing rather than house made.  With how good their fries are, they need a good house made ranch.  Even people who don't eat ranch on their fries would want this for a topper on a chicken sandwich or even one of the burgers.  Another thing I noticed was the burger being smashed down while cooking.  Even though they are thinner burgers, the number one rule cooking burger is to never smash.  I think it would make for a much juicer burger if this rule was followed.

Overall I enjoyed my experience here and I look forward to going back and trying some other burgers and sandwiches.",2,0,0,True,3,331,0.22290825302934394

She even went above and beyond and put my chicken sandwich in a separate bag then my husbands since he got burger and I had told her I do not eat beef. How nice! 

The fries are fresh cut and they have vinegar available to put on them which is my favorite! My chicken sandwich was cooked well and had a nice seasoning. I love that they have turkey bacon here!

I have had excellent service each of the 3 times that I have gone so far. The fries are very good, they appear to be fresh cut and are seasoned well with seasoning salt. They use  high quality ingredients and I was told that they use never frozen beef that contains some steak to improve the flavor. The buns and toppings are excellent as well. Unfortunately, the beef patties are a bit on the rubbery/chewy side as if the beef is being overworked in the mixing and forming prior to cooking. Because of that it is hard to rate them higher than 3.5 stars but I decided to round up because of the good service and ingredients. If they fix the texture of the beef patties I will raise the score of my review. Overall they are doing many things well and I hope they stick around.",1,1,1,False,1,180,1

This is a diner in Pittsburgh.  That's Pittsburgh PA.  But wait then I see a stand-up menu advertising wings and Yuengling beer!  I was still like, nah.

2 eggs any style, 2 strips of bacon or 2 sausage links, toast and choice of hash browns or home fries.

First off, this is a pretty decent sized Target. It has a Starbucks, Target cafe, and Pizza Hut Express cafe all located inside. The clothing section is HUGE with tons of brands and merchandise to choose from. However, the downside is that there is less space allocated for the food and grocery area. There is no fresh produce here, which for me personally is a turn off. When I'm out shopping I'm definitely looking for convenience and trying to minimalize how many places I need to go. When I go to this Target, I find myself having to still stop at Giant Eagle or ALDI to grab my fresh fruits and veggies and a few other food items. The store does have a lot of great finds, and customer service is pretty good. Today, we received excellent customer service from Richmond in the checkout line. My only complaint other than the small grocery selection is that the merchandise could definitely be a bit more organized and the bathroom could really use more frequent maintenance. It tends to smell like rotten food, (especially today!) and there is a problem with gnats.

The cashier paid the $4 for me as I did not have any money on me. As grateful as I was, it was a fiasco that could have been avoided. If you have gift cards, make sure you take cash with you as well.

My purchases at this store are typically bluray releases as I'm a fan of their exclusive steelbook releases.

I have recently moved closer to the Target in E. Liberty and have had the chance to really compare the two Targets as far as selection and service. The McKnight location OWNS. I needed some storage for my large shoe collection and random collection of odds and ends that, like Rachel C., I've picked up from their $1 section hehe. ;) All of the locations I visited around town would have two or three of the options represented on their website, which greatly disappointed me as there were others online that I wanted to check out. Lo and behold, on a random stroll into the McKnight collection, they were pretty much all there! Selection: McKnight wins.

As far as service, a lot of people tout this particular trait of all Targets and I did before I moved to Pittsburgh. The McKnight location is the only one where I have felt that every employee, from the cashiers to the Starbucks baristas to the floor workers, are very nice and helpful. I have seriously never had a bad trip to this Target. Service: McKnight wins!

Corniness aside, the only pain for me with this Target prior to my move was how much the drive to it sucked (I hate driving in N. Hills lol), which is not a real mark against them. Now I have discovered a much easier and quicker route and I love hitting this location up, even if I don't actually need anything.

I literally talk myself out of stopping by a Target if I'm within the vicinity of one.  I may even have Target-dar...those are some special powers, let me tell you! 

I love the clothes because they fit my curvy girl body type.  I do tend to avoid the juniors section as they tend to run on the small side, but the Merona brand dresses fit like a glove!  Juniors would fit like a scandalous glove.  The prices can vary.  Sometimes you can grab a great deal off the discount racks.  Other times I'll drop $40 for a dress because I love the fit and I know I'll wear it for a while.  When in reality there'd be no way I'd spend $40 for a dress at Forever 21! 

The shoe selections are usually always great because they knock off Steven Madden designs quite often, plus they're half the price....score! 

My whole house could replicate a Target home section.  I think there's a lot of outrageously priced home stores out there and Target is by far the most affordable.  Plus the decor is just fun and hip!

Unlike others, I got us signed up ok, but it did take me a while to figure out the App name vs. the bike rental, but once I  found  the app and downloaded it, sign up went pretty smooth. 

The bikes themselves though felt quite unstable to me. The handlebars are too high or too out front making the front wheel feel not quite in control. (We've rented share bikes in lots of other cities, these were the worst.) I felt like every time I got on and tried to get going there was a lot of initial unstableness. 

At one station we accidentally tried to unlock a bike that was out of service, user error, we didn't notice the small flashing red 'out of service' light, since we were new to this rental company. But it let us pick the bike and gave us a PIN #, but then wouldn't unlock because it was broken. Why in the world do they even let you rent a broken bike? We then unlocked a working one, and took off. Of course we now had 3 bikes ticking down and we couldn't get the broken one to cancel.  I had to call customer service and explain what happened and they were very nice and removed it from our account and cancelled the charge. But who likes calling customer service? Not me. 

Anyways - I appreciate the fact that there were / are bikes to rent, the price was good, and I liked that the lock on the wheel means you don't have to dock it. That's a cool option. It was a quicker / decent way to get around the city for short jaunts and meant we saw more then we would on foot.   It just seems they could get better quality / more stable bikes, and fix the broken ones, or at the very least, change their system so you can't accidentally rent a broken bike.

This bike had an abnormally high level of base resistance (think me having to pedal DOWNHILL), and while I initially chalked it up to my level of fitness being lower than my friend's, we identified the problem easily when we switched bikes. 

Maybe I'm pissed off that I put in a lot of leg work for nothing. To be fair, should I also have figured this out before biking miles away from the nearest rental rack? Probably. 

However, I tried explaining this problem to customer service, and it was clear the lady on the other end was not equipped to address anything of the sort. 
1) She kept mistaking my problem with the bike as a problem with returning it.
2) She didn't seem to care that the bike was faulty. Maybe if customer service had actually been in Pittsburgh, she would have had more stock in it. It would have been nice to get some assurance that the next time I borrow, I won't have the same problem with my bike.
3) She told me that any charge reductions would only be applicable for situations of problems with bike return. 

I invested not only money but also time and effort into this extended bike trip, and in contrast with my last experiences, the bike ruined it for me.

For someone who hasn't been on a bike outside of a spin class room in quite some time, it is amazing. 

Returning the bike was NOT as easy process. First, I hit RENT/RETURN on the kiosk and it tells you to enter you info, so I did, which inadvertently rented another bike.

It is not user friendly and frankly just as crappy as the kiosks. Last resort I called the customer service number and the gentleman was very helpful and returned ALL my rented bikes. The next time I tried it when I returned the bike, everything went well, or so I thought, and the bike didn't actually return and I was charged for a 24 rental. They tell you to ""check for the light"" when returning but I am not 100% sure to which light they are referring. They charged me $42+ for an overnight rental and I have still yet to see it back. They tried to ""refund"" it to my bike account by I may not use this $40 worth of bike because of the hassle. (I also really wish they would use an American call center and manufacturers. Especially given that it's operated by PITTSBURGH BIKE SHARE! I mean, come on!)
If you try it, here are some tips that make life easier. 

TIP 1) Rent and return the bike FROM THE BIKE!!! There is a keypad on each bike, if you use those, the processes are much smoother. 
TIP 2) Verify via the website or app your rental has been returned!! Don't trust the ""light system"" or bike
TIP 3) Enter the customer service number into your phone...you will need it sooner or...sooner
TIP 4) THEY DO NOT CHARGE THE CREDIT CARD YOUR GIVE ONLINE!!! The credit card number is only for collateral, if the bike is broken or stolen. I still would not have paid any of my fees had I not gone on the site. 
TIP 5) Read all the Q&A on the site. They are enlightening. 

All said though, I LOVELOVELOVE the idea of this, but the execution was awful, from the kiosks to the website. They need to fix the kiosk problems, figure out some way to accurately let you know what is happening with your rental, completely revamp the website, and just make it...biker friendly.",5,1,1,True,3,519,0.3733791855977001

MY #1 PIECE OF ADVICE: get everything set up before you go out to ride! Specifically, (1) register online for an account, (2) get your credit card set up (there's a $1 activation that gets applied to your first ride), (3) download the Nextbike app so you can use your smartphone to rent the bikes.

Alright. If you're as neurotic as me, you should be good to go. Here are some more notes about my experience today. 

+ I'm not a bike expert, but I had a pleasant time using the bikes. Each bike's got a nifty bell and 7 gears, plus some other handy features.
+/- I liked that there was a front basket, but it was kind of small and had really big gaps.
+ There are a lot of locations, so it was easy to find a bike. I personally like the Transit app for seeing where the bikes are as opposed to the Nextbike app. 
+ No problem with selecting a bike to rent on my phone, entering the pin on the bike, and unlocking it.
- There's no way to see the duration of time you've rented the bike, so you kind of just have to keep track. 
- The cable locks aren't working yet (their website says so too), which is sad because I was worried about leaving my little bike baby in strange locations. I reaaally hope this gets fixed soon. 
- The payment log in the app was kind of wonky... one ride was 4.28 for 62 minutes (where did the 28 cents come from??) and another got logged as 2.14 for 1 minute (when it was really more like 40 minutes). 

I had a decent time riding in Pittsburgh and didn't have to deal with too many hills. I kind of bonded with my bike in the two hours we spent, and I'll be back for more quality time with her soon. :)",3,1,0,True,2,355,0.371361390668963

First off, let me back track and say this is AMAZING that Pittsburgh has a bike rental service. We now have wide open bike lanes, a bike friendly community and people ready to hop on there and ride. Me being on of them. But hop on and ride I did not...

I had friends in from out of town and thought this would be the perfect opportunity to try this out for the first time. Probably in hindsight I should have done my research, but how hard could bike rental be? Very hard it turns out. I tried earlier to bring up their website and figure out how to tackle the steps needed before going. I was very confused with their website in terms of how to sign up. Plus, I thought it was weird there was no prompted for an app. When I googled an app, I couldn't find one either, so I figured there was none. I finally signed up for what was the first step. I tried to enter my credit card for the second step and it kept denying it. 

We went to the kiosk on 10th and Penn and there was a kiosk, so I thought good, I can just do the transaction there. After typing in my phone number a couple times and then the pin I got in the email, the VERY sensitive key bad literally blacked out. Broken. Well... we finally got someone's card to work on their website and got the bikes out... after a half an hour of sorting out the rental process. 

We gloriously rode down the Penn Ave bike lane. Wind in our hair, bell ringing and waving to happy people passing us by. It was awesome. We went to the Strip and locked our bikes up outside of Bella Notte and sat down for a bite. After some delicious pizza we were ready to roll again. After typing in 3 of the 4 pins we needed for our bikes, the last bike wouldn't unlock. Well, that's odd. We tried everything... they give you two pins, which is confusing in itself. We'd type in the two pins and then the screen would black out. 

So we called costumer service and proceeded to be put on hold for over a half hour. We finally go through to India, because that's were the call center apparently is. We find out that there's a city wide issue and all the bikes are broken. Great. So we somehow convinced the dude to refund us for that bike. We literally had to leave the bike there, sadly. 

So we biked down a couple blocks to the 21st and Smallman station and locked the 3 bikes up. We ended up seeing another sad looking couple who was also sitting on hold for the same problem. What a crappy situation. Thankfully, we were refunded for all 4 bikes, which was awesome, but still it kinda ruined our plans for the day. 

Again, I'm SO excited that we have something like this in Pittsburgh, although I wish they would have gone with an American company instead of what I believe is a German manufacturer. And how about having an American call center as well... or better yet, a local one? How about one step further and have people out on the streets covering some ground when there's issues. 

Some might say I'm crazy, but I'll give it another try. But I'll be wary. 

IMPORTANT INFO: they do have an app called NextBike, so download it. I know, the name doesn't match up, but I think it's the company that runs them. My advice is to add all your information and have your credit card stored so you can hopefully have an easier time than I did!

My hope is that I can come back in a couple months and write a five star review.",22,9,5,True,1,673,1

Not sure what has come over me but I kind of like it.  I like looking through items and thinking what if I had this.  I have also come to the realization that you don't always need to buy new when you are looking for unique.

I really enjoyed this place because they have something for just about everybody in here.  What one person may find tacky another will enjoy immensely.  The downstairs is setup nicely.  You can easily maneuver through the area and see everything they have on display.  Don't think that this is all that they have in store, venture upstairs.

Upstairs takes a little more time to go through.  But it is still a great area to go through.  I was drawn to this map of the city, of course I was too late as it was sold.  Would make a great wall piece.  There were also an abundance of globes that were dated, but kind of awesome.  I also eyed in on a coat rack, but had to talk myself out of it as I really didn't need it.

Don't mind the noise when you are upstairs as this sits underneath Arsenal Bowling.

They didn't have the chaise lounge so I was looking for but the furniture inside is beautiful. Sometimes I wonder how they get such unique items in their store. The second floor there was some really nice dining room tables and chair sets. It made me think maybe I'm due for an upgrade to something more vintage.

The prices are pretty reasonable and they have a vast array of different items. I found a few things that I liked that I filed a way in my memory maybe for Christmas. 

The staff that was working today was helpful and while I didn't find what I wanted she encouraged me to look around to see if there was something else that piqued my interest.
