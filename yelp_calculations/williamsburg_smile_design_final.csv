The office is very nice and in a convenient location, and both the dentist and the receptionists seemed nice.  I went in for a consultation before I had the Groupon cleaning, because I was having some pain in my jaw and wanted to get it taken care of quickly.  Dr. Mapes took some xrays and said that the problem was a cavity.  I came in the next day and had it filled.  \n\nDr. Mapes hit a nerve while giving me anesthetic, and it was the most painful injection I've ever had.  (After the filling, I couldn't open my mouth wide enough to eat regularly for 10 days.)  The filling felt very strange afterwards - the shape was very different than pre-filling, it had edges sharp enough to cut my tongue on, and my teeth didn't close right.  I went in the next day to have him file it down, and he basically told me it wasn't his fault that the filling felt wrong.\n\nA few weeks later, I went in for my cleaning.  It was the most painful, bloodiest cleaning I've had in my life.  I've never felt anything close to this sort of pain at a dental cleaning before.  The hygenist blamed it on me.  I'll admit I don't floss every day, but I've never had a cleaning close to this painful or bloody before.  \n\nMeanwhile, the initial pain I came in for hadn't gone away, so I went in for another appointment.  Dr. Mapes took more xrays and said that there was actually another cavity in a tooth two teeth down from the first filling.  I asked why he didn't tell me about that one the first time, and he didn't have much of an explanation.  He said there was also another cavity on the other side, so I went in and had those two cavities filled.  They felt strange, just like the first one.\n\nThe pain still didn't go away, so I went to my long-time family dentist for a second opinion while visiting home at Christmas.  She took xrays and examined my mouth.  She then said that the three cavities Dr. Mapes filled were the worst examples of amalgam fillings she's seen in her career.  She explained that the cavities he did weren't even sealed.  Besides that, one of the cavities he filled was in a tooth that didn't even need to be filled!  The tooth that was actually causing me the pain was BETWEEN the two teeth he filled.  The second dentist repaired all of Dr. Mapes's work, at great cost, and said I might lose the teeth eventually because of his shoddy work.  \n\nWondering why Dr. Mapes appears to have such good reviews?  He gives you a whitening toothbrush on the way out the door if you write a good review while you're checking out. \n\nIf you're just going in for a cleaning, whitening, or something basic, I'm sure this office will be ok.

That went totally fine, and I thought it was great that Dr. Mapes actually comes in and does the cleaning himself (no offense to dental hygenists, but it was nice to have a dentist who actually felt ""involved"" for once.) \n\nMy problems came up with me agreeing to get a night guard, since this was the second dentist who recommended one to me. It was greatly discounted, so that convinced me to go for it. I had the impressions taken, then when I came back for a fitting, I was told that there was a problem with the fit, that the lab messed up. So I say, okay, I'll expect to come back in a week. No one called me. Meanwhile, I was going through finals, getting ready to graduate, leave New York, was kind of busy. Incidentally, a 40 minute subway ride each way is not ideally how one would spend their time in these circumstances.\n\nI call a couple weeks later, and was told I should have been called because the night guard was ready. I made it clear that I was upset, and Dr. Mapes apologized for his receptionist's screw up, which would have been all well and good, but then I was told the night guard didn't fit AGAIN and that this never normally happens. At this point I was starting to wonder who actually messed up the impressions. I was told this would be rushed, and I said it would have to obviously be ready before I left New York. \n\nGot called again, maybe a week later. Was told it was fine this time. At first the night guard didn't stay in at night at all, and it is a little wobby, doesn't fit exactly. I called (from CA by now) to ask if I could get a refund if there was a problem, and explained the problem. I was told that wouldn't be possible, and that there was no problem. An explanation/talking about the night guard would have been nice, rather than being told I could deal with it by having it sent to a lab or something here.\n\nIn sum, I'd say go here for a basic cleaning.

Part of it was lack of dental insurance during a year of road trips followed by art residencies and startup gigs in California; now I'm all set in NYC with a stable job.  So I scheduled this appointment the moment I had a free minute after my new coverage kicked in.  I was expecting a wickedly painful cleaning - and a lot of sighing and head-shaking from a dentist who would be irritated about how much remedial work my neglected teeth needed.  And I was pretty bummed about spending one of my first Saturday mornings in Brooklyn at the dentist's. \n\nWilliamsburg Smile Design turned out to be nothing that I dreaded, not even a waste of a Saturday morning.  The office is sleek and pleasant, with white couches and tasteful mod decor.  The receptionist and hygienist were genuinely friendly and upbeat, so I had a pretty fine relaxing morning despite the click-scrape-whirrrr-whirrrr of metal tools and water and teeny suction hoses in my mouth.  The hygienist was very knowledgeable (totally unlike the usual going-through-the-motions grump), and readily discussed some options for post-ortho work I can have done to make my teeth brushing routine less of a hassle.  The Doc himself was what ya call a swell guy. I do need to have a few minor issues addressed at a later appointment, and he let me know about it without any condescension.  \n\nI'll be returning to Smile Design next month, and I'm almost ... looking forward to a dental appointment?

See, I had also just spent a weekend in an incredible amount of pain due to an infection under a tooth that should have been taken out a long time ago. I'm one of those people that doesn't go to the dentist until the very last minute, when drastic measures are usually needed. It's a fault of mine.\n\nSo I went in pain with this coupon, expecting some tsk-tsking as I'd always gotten from dentists in the past. Instead I got caring, nonjudgmental, sincere advice and treatment. Dr. Mapes actually scheduled me info for a root canal ASAP (which was *incredibly* painless and easy) and here I am a few weeks later still amazed at the quality and care I received.\n\nOne last thing: the five stars above aren't just for Dr. Mapes; Jasmine (his Dental Assistant) and Hadeel (Office Manager) deserve them just as much.

And, to have a nice dentist in my neighborhood was great, and saved me from having to trek to yucky Times Square where my old dentist was.  \n\nFirst of all, love any doctor that uses ZocDoc... scheduling appointments online is the BEST and really makes the process easy.  I've had nothing but good experiences with doctors (and now dentists) that I've booked on ZocDoc.  Next, the office is AMAZING.  It's super modern and clean, feels almost like a spa.  I got there 15 minutes early and filled out some paper work, helped myself to a snack (they have some granola bars and tea out for consumption) and was promptly   at 5:45 in the dentist chair, right on schedule (also, a dentist that is open after work is also a huge bonus for me).  Each of the examination rooms has a Netflix Instant flat screen TV so you can watch something while you are waiting or, I'd imagine, while you are getting some work done on your teeth.  I didn't have time for this however as the appointment went very quickly.  There is also a computer screen on the ceiling so you can look at your x-rays... or maybe the Netflix?  I'm not sure but my x-rays were up there when I was in the chair.\n\nMy teeth look and feel great and I was out the door in 20 minutes.  The only reason I'm deducting a star is that it all felt a little TOO quick.  Maybe my old dentist was slow or something but I left feeling a little worried that maybe he had missed something.  But I'm not a dentist so I can't make that judgement call really.  All in all, a great experience and I shall be back.
