one idea is to look at similarity between elite yelper reviews and see how similar it is to
the chronologically 5 previous reviews

calculate how similar it is to the previous 5 reviews

** all for the same restauraunt

-- start with 100 reviews, 1 location (New York, 100 restaurants)

the metric is: how similar is it to the previous 5 years, calculate for all reviews, does it differ for elite yelpers and everyone else?
